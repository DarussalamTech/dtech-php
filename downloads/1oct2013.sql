It is rich in information, references, bibliography, and illustrations. It has been reviewed and edited by many professors and well-educated people. It is brief and simple to read, yet contains much scientific knowledge.\r\nBrief Overview\r\n\r\nThe first chapter, Some Evidence for the Truth of Islam, answers some important questions which some people ask:\r\n\r\n    Is the Quran truly the literal word of God, revealed by Him?\r\n    Is Muhammad (S) truly a prophet sent by God?\r\n    Is Islam truly a religion from God?\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, six kinds of evidence are mentioned:\r\n\r\n    The Scientific Miracles in the Holy Quran\r\n    The Great Challenge to Produce One Chapter Like the Chapters of the Holy Quran\r\n    Biblical Prophecies on the Advent of Muhammad (S), the Prophet of Islam\r\n    The Verses in the Quran That Mention Future Events Which Later Came to Pass\r\n    Miracles Performed by the Prophet Muhammad (S)\r\n    The Simple Life of Muhammad (S)\r\n\r\nFrom these six kinds of evidence, we conclude that:\r\n\r\n    The Quran must be the literal word of God, revealed by Him.\r\n    Muhammad (S) is truly a prophet sent by God.\r\n    Islam is truly a religion from God.\r\n\r\nIf we would like to know if a religion is true or false, we should not depend on our emotions, feelings, or traditions. Rather, we should depend on our reason and intellect. When God sent the prophets, He supported them with miracles and evidence which proved that they were truly prophets sent by God and hence that the religion they came with is true.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter, Some Benefits of Islam, mentions some of the benefits that Islam provides for the individual, such as:\r\n\r\n    The Door to Eternal Paradise\r\n    Salvation from Hellfire\r\n    Real Happiness and Inner Peace\r\n    Forgiveness for All Previous Sins.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter, General Information on Islam, provides general information on Islam, corrects some misconceptions about it, and answers some commonly asked questions, such as:\r\n\r\n    What does Islam say about terrorism?\r\n    What is the status of women in Islam?','A great book for Dawah, containing basic information about Islam.

Many of these books are well written and provide an informative and comprehensive view of how Salat should be performed according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Unfortunately, there are very few books in English which deal with the subject in the same informative and comprehensive way. The books, which do exist, have three main disadvantages:\r\n\r\nFirstly, literature concerning Salat available in English is either so brief that it does not cover essential points in nearly enough detail, or it is so bulky and detailed that it becomes difficult to use it for quick reference, and essential points may get lost in the unnecessary detail.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the text of the Salat lacks the quality of direct research from the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). There are also books which contain material without any reference to the original sources.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the majority of books have been written according to the views held by certain schools of thought and for this reason some people hesitate to follow them.\r\n\r\nBecause of these weaknesses in existing literature in English, we felt that the need existed to produce a medium sized book on Salat which would approach the subject according to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). The Prophet, himself, said: \\\"Pray as you have seen me praying.\\\"\r\n\r\nSuch a book needs to contain all the essential details of Salat without being too bulky or complicated so that the reader can use it as a point of reference on a journey or at home.\r\n\r\nIt was also felt that a comprehensive book on Salat in English would be useful for converts to Islam and for such Muslims who do not fully understand Arabic and Urdu languages. Keeping in mind the needs of our brothers and sisters, every effort has been made to produce this book in simple and easy language.\r\n\r\nDuring our research, we sometimes found that differences occurred between established practices in various prayer books. In these circumstances we referred to authentic Ahadith of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), so that the points could be clarified as much as possible. This was, because, for a true Muslim there is no greater proof for settling arguments than authentic Ahadith and practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).\r\n\r\nWe hope that Allah will accept this humble attempt because without His Support and Help we would never have been able to do this work. Finally, we ask all our Muslim brothers and sisters to study the text and to strive to offer Salat (prayer) according to it. If anyone finds anything unacceptable or to be against the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh) we would be grateful if they would inform us.','Offer Salah the way how Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) taught his Companions (r.a) to offer this obligatory worship.',1,'1',0,'19','2013-06-27 12:00:31',1,'2013-06-27 12:00:31',1),(698,'A Man and a Horse','A-Man-and-a-Horse',57,'Islam is a religion of peace, justice and humanism.

He was a mercy not just to believers, but to disbelievers as well, for he would invite them to come out of darkness and into the light of true guidance. He is a favor and blessing for mankind, not just the Arabs, the people among whom he was sent, but for people of all races and colors. His staunchest enemies became his closest followers when the cloud of blind prejudice was removed from their sight and when they were able, for the very first time, to see with clarity the true nature of the Prophet\'s character. This book deals with many of the qualities that the Prophet possessed that made him the mercy to everyone. It starts with His perfect lineage, His noble upbringing, and his fully dedicated worship. This book then gives many of the qualities of the Prophet including his generosity, humbleness, bravery, patience, and leadership to name a few. Each chapter includes examples from the life of the Prophet on how he was the perfect living example of that quality.

Besides there ware so many evils in them that it seemed as if the Jahiliyya days had come again.\r\nImam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahhab simply called people to Islam - to the Oneness of Allah and a total transformation of life in accordance with the Qur\\\'an and sunnah. In this call, it was quite natural that he had to insist on the pristine purity of Islam at the expense of polytheistic beliefs and deeds, heresies as well as innovations.\r\nMany great personalities of Islam in different parts of the world have got inspiration from the life and mission of Imam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahhab and spread his reformative message in their lands. Indeed it was a great movement which influenced almost all parts of the Islamic world. This book has a lecture on the life and mission of the Imam, which was delivered by H.E. Sheikh Abdul Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz in 1385 A.H.','A exceptional writing on the life and the mission of Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab.',1,'1',0,'23','2013-06-28 07:00:00',1,'2013-06-28 07:00:00',1),(706,'Abridged Biography of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)','Abridged-Biography-of-Prophet-',57,'Many books have been published on the Biography of the Prophet (pbuh) by different authors and compilers, but this book is different from them as it has been written by the great Imam Muhammad ibn \\\'Abdul Wahhab At-Tamimi and never published before.\r\nA committee was appointed to collect the writings of Imam Muhammad Ibn \\\'Abdul Wahhab throughout the Muslim world and compile this book from printed, handwritten and microfilm sources.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nAfter Imam Muhammad bin Sa\\\'ud Islamic University had decided to hold a conference in the name of Shaikh Muhammad bin \\\'Abdul Wahhab, it formed a committee to prepare for this conference and to provide a detailed concept of it and then to implement it.\r\nThe committee began its work by restating its general objective for the conference, which was to inform people about the Shaikh and reveal the truth of his Da\\\'wah throughout the Muslim world and to dispel the doubts and uncertainties about it which have become common in some Islamic countries and during certain periods in history.\r\nWhile striving to attain this objective in a scientific and correct manner, the committee came to the conclusion that it was necessary to collect all of the Shaikh\\\'s written works and to substantiate their attribution to him and to confirm it, then to publish them in a special printing in the name of the University, in order to send copies of it after that to the organizations and researchers who would be invited to take part in the conference. Regarding this, the committee kept in mind the fact that many researchers in Muslim countries do not have available the books of the Shaikh and his written scholarly works, which would, without any doubt, have a clear effect on the shortcomings, incompleteness or mistakes of some of the things which they might write about the Shaikh\\\'s Da\\\'wah, for that reason, it was essential the genuine works of the Shaikh be available to them in an authentic form, so that they might become acquainted with the truth of his Da \\\'wah and the unbiased scholarly works which have been written about it.\r\nHence, the committee proceeded to collect all of the works of the Shaikh which they could, both printed and handwritten and to search for them in every place they could think of, with individuals belonging to the Shaikh\\\'s family, in public and private libraries and in all parts of the Kingdom and outside it. In this regard, we would like to indicate the large number of handwritten works of the Shaikh which we found in As-Sa\\\'udiyyah Library at Dukhnah, in Riyadh; the committee copied these manuscripts and they also obtained copies of the printed works of the Shaikh by purchasing them, being given them as gifts, through private connections and by borrowing some printed works which were few in number or were rare from individuals and organizations.\r\nThe Committee also published and broadcast an announcement, in which they called upon those who possessed any written or printed works of the Shaikh to present them to the Committee; and they sent letters carrying the same meaning to a number of well known personalities who had ties to him and his family, both in the Kingdom and abroad.\r\nThey also made personal contact with some individuals who had some special interest in the Shaikh, his Da\\\'wah and his written works, or who had written something of value about them. Also, during the summer vacation of the year 1396 A. H. (1976 C. E.), some members of the Committee undertook a search of some of the important libraries in Egypt and other countries in order to become acquainted with any of the works of the Shaikh which might be there and then to work on bringing whatever was possible from these works to help with the requirements of the Committee.\r\nAs a result of all this, many copies from among the works of the Shaikh were collected, both printed and handwritten and on microfilm. Then a board was appointed from among the members of the Committee to classify these works and their responsibilities included the following:\r\n1. Examining each work, whether printed or handwritten and verifying that it was really one of the works of the Shaikh. 2. Gathering all of the printed and handwritten copies and describing each copy. 3. Recording the category in which each work belonged (Aqeedah [Beliefs], Fiqh [Islamic Jurisprudence], Seerah [Biography of the Prophet (S) and treatises)\r\nAlso, a number of subcommittees were formed for the purpose of authentication and their responsibilities included the following:\r\n1. Comparing the printed and handwritten copies of each book with each other in order to obtain a complete copy, which could be prepared for printing. 2. Numbering the Qur\\\'anic Verses, mentioning the Surahs from which they came and adding the diacritical marks to them. 3. Adding punctuation and paragraphs and making the chapter headings stand out, in accordance with the modern system of writing and printing. 4. Ascertaining the authenticity of works presented to the board of classification whose attribution to the Shaikh was in doubt. The Conference Committee took great care that every one of the authentication subcommittees was composed of specialized scholars with a strong connection to the type and nature of the work which they were reviewing. They also took care to the best of their ability, to ensure that each subcommittee brought together a number of scholars whose collective expertise in the field of authentication was complete. And in this regard, the Committee sought help from some expert scholars from outside the Committee.\r\nSo these works of the Shaikh, the conference Committee presents, complete and authenticated, as the first result its formation and its work. And what the Committee intended by its efforts was to reveal the truth of the Shaikh\\\'s Da\\\'wah and to make it easy for people to study it and refer to it, based upon all of his written works, without addition, omission or commentary, to allow those who study, write and search for the truth regarding it to reach it by the firmest path, whilst avoiding every untruth, distortion or false claim, the bearer of which seeks to disguise the truth.\r\nAnd the Committee expresses the hope that the success of its work is equal to the efforts which its members have exerted.','A summarized but authentic biography of the Prophet of Islam (pbuh) by Imam Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab.',1,'1',0,'24','2013-06-28 07:16:55',1,'2013-06-28 07:16:55',1),(707,'Advisors of the Prophet (PBUH)','Advisors-of-the-Prophet-(PBUH)',57,'<p>This book includes the biographies of the following great Sahabah: \'Abdullah bin Zaid, Sa\'d bin Ar-Rabi, \'Abdullah bin Jahsh, Salman Al-Farisi, \'Abdullah bin Rawahah, Al-Hubab bin Al-Mundhir, Usaid bin Hudair, Usamah bin Zaid, Sa\'d bin Mu\'adh, Naufal bin Mu\'awiyah, Sa\'d bin \'Ubadah, and Malik bin Sinan (May Allah be pleased with them all).</p>','Biographies of twelve Companions of Messenger of Allah (PBUH).',1,'0',0,'25','2013-06-28 09:35:49',1,'2013-09-03 05:30:38',2),(708,'Affection & Aversion (Al-Walaa and Al-Baraa)','Affection-&-Aversion-(Al-Walaa',57,'<p>Publisher\'s Note: The subject of Walaa\' (affection) for believers and Baraa\' (aversion) with disbelievers is one of the most important religious issues which is related to the Articles of Faith.

Unfortunately, the majority of Muslims nowadays follow and imitate disbelievers in customs, rituals and traditions which are against the teachings of Islam. It will be useful if they follow them in the field of technology and science. This book sheds light on this topic to implant the spirit of joining and supporting the believers and warns them against the bad consequences of copying the same style of life of disbelievers.

In fact, the Prophet, said that prayers are the worship itself, or to be exact, the main part of it. Allah likes that His creatures worship Him and pray to Him, because the worship and the prayers are the physical and practical way of declaring our faith and creed that Allah alone has created us and only He is to be worshipped. Allah has prescribed for us the ways and acts of worship. As Allah does not burden His creatures more than they could bear, the prescribed acts of worship are the minimum one should perform. But to get nearer to Allah and to attain His Pleasure, we should do something more than the prescribed acts. In this regard the prayers and supplications are the most easy acts of worship for us to adopt. We are fortunate that the Prophet has guided us about how to pray and has taught us the supplications we should make on various occasions. In this book, the emphasis is on the style so that the children can easily understand the significance of prayers and supplications. All these are taken from the Qur\'an and the authentic books of Hadeeths.

We are aware of some of these sins and mistakes but we find it hard to avoid them. There are also some mistakes and sins which we commit and of which we are not aware. Another fact is that the good acts we perform are nullified by some kinds of sins and mistakes which we make. Therefore, the only way to save our good deeds is to ask Allah for forgiveness. In this regard consideration should be made that no one is liable to attain success and enter Paradise on account of his good deeds, unless Allah bestows His mercy upon him. Because the blessings of Allah and His favors upon us are so numerous that we can never thank Allah or perform the acts of worship to equal them from our side. So, it is another blessing of Allah upon us that He forgives us our sins if we repent and ask His forgiveness. The more we remember Allah and regret our mistakes and sins, the more we get His mercy and His favors. In this book the same explanation has been produced which is clear to the understanding of the children. All the parents should consider providing this book to their children so that they may make a habit of asking forgiveness from Allah on a regular basis.

The Sealed Nector was honored by the World Muslim League as first prize winner book. Whoever wants to know the whole life style of the Prophet in detail must read this book. Muhammad (pbuh) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him, are severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurah (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (Paradise). (Al-Fath: 29) The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth. Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah\'s Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet) and learns and then teaches it to others. The (last example is that of a) person who does not care for it and does not take Allah\'s Guidance revealed through me (he is like that barren land).\" (Al-Mukarramah) Note: The main difference between the different sizes is the cover and the size of the text.</p>\r\n<h3>Publishers Note:</h3>\r\n<p>The heart of every Muslim is filled with love for the last Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and this love of the messenger of Allah is an asset for him. Love and respect of a person depends on the benefits we get from him, As the Prophet , is the greatest benefactor of humanity, every Muslim has deepest love for him, Every deed of his life is to be followed by every individual of the Muslim Ummah. Highest love for the Prophet (pbuh) is made a test of our Faith. Allah the All-Mighty has described and explained the status of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Qur\'an: \"Say (O Muhammad (pbuh) to mankind): If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic monotheism, follow the Qur\'an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you...\" (3:31) Love of Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh) is a part of our Faith. There is a Hadith (narration) of the Prophet (pbuh) who said: \"None of you has Faith unless I am dearer to him than his father and his son and all mankind.\" In the early period of Islam, many books were written on the life of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Qur\'an itself, the best example of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), has also been mentioned, The Qur\'an says: \"And verily, you (O Muhammad (pbuh) are on an exalted standard of character.\" (68:4) Someone asked \'Aishah (R) about the noble character and manners of the Prophet (pbuh). She answered: \"Have you not read the Qur\'an? His character is a complete explanation of the Qur\'an.\" It means that whatever is commanded and prohibited in the Qur\'an, its practical example is present in the manners of Muhammad In other words, the ideal and perfect example of good manners and character which the Qur\'an demands from mankind, was present in the person of Muhammad in its highest degree. Scholars of Ahadith (traditions) and writers of the biography of Muhammad , the Messenger of Allah, have explored his life from every angle and aspect from birth to death. Every event, every incident of his life has been described and narrated, but none had claimed that he has given his life\'s recording its full rights. Hundreds of books have been written on the life of Muhammad and this endeavor will continue till the Day of Resurrection. No doubt The Sealed Nectar (Ar-Raheeq AI-Makhturn) is a book of great value and praiseworthy work on the life of Muhammad. This book has been written by the Eminent Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri of Jamiah Salafiyah, Banaras (India). The first Islamic Conference on Seerah (biography of the Prophet) was held in 1976 in Pakistan sponsored by the Muslim World League. The League announced a world contest for writing a book on the life of the Prophet. One hundred fifty thousand Saudi Riyals (SR 150,000) (forty thousand U.S. Dollars) was the grand prize for the best five books. One hundred and seventy-one manuscripts were received from all over the world. Out of these, eighty-five were in the Arabic Language, sixty-four in Urdu, twenty-one were in English and one in French and Hausa. A board of highly qualified scholars judged the manuscripts and announced the results. The manuscript of Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, Jamiah Salafiyah Banaras (India), author of the book in hand (The Sealed Nectar) received first the grand prize of SR 50,000 (fifty thousand Saudi Riyals) for its authentic and sound collections of the narrations. Dr. Majid Ali Khan, New Delhi, India, placed second. The third prize went to Dr. Naseer Ahmed, Islamic University, Lahore, Pakistan. The fourth prize was awarded to Mr. Harnid Mahmud of Egypt. The fifth and final prize was awarded to Abdus-Salam Hashim of Madinah Munawwarah. An extravagant prize distribution ceremony was held at Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 12 Rabi\'ul-Awwal 1399 A.H. (1979 C.E.). Afterwards, the book was published by the Muslim World League and then many other organizations gained the honor of publishing this masterpiece. Darussalam also published this book in the Arabic language. I had wished to publish this book in the English language for the wider benefit of humanity. Shaikh Safiur-Rahman willingly agreed to the idea and consented to publish the English translation. The stage of translation was traversed with the help of brother Mahir Abu Dhahab, owner and general manager of Markaz Noor Ash-Sham in Damascus, Syria. For the first edition of this book, brother Mahir Abu Dhahab from Syria, Damascus, provided his help and cooperation as regards the translation work for which I offer my special thanks to him. Now in your hands is the new revised edition with many changes and additions. Brother Abu Khaliyl (U.S.A.) amended and improved the translation to make its language simple and easy, besides comparing again from the beginning to the end the English translation with the Arabic revised text to update the changes therein. So, after a coherent toil of months, this edition was published. (All praise is for Allah).

It helps whoever recites the Qur\'an or studies it to specify the locations mentioned by the Noble Verses, and to mark those places of ancient people mentioned in the Qur\'an. This is besides locating areas where the incidents of the prophetic Seerah occurred. Eventually the diligent reader will easily recognize those places, learn about them, and take heed of them while reciting.</p>\r\n<p>Eventually the diligent reader will easily recognize those places, learn about them, and take heed of them while reciting. The Atlas has also revealed obscure places we used to pass through inattentively, like the site where Nuh\'s Ark settled, the site of the curved Sand-hills (Al Ahqah), the cave of the young faithful men, the houses of median, the site of Sodom and other places determined by the Atlas depending on reliable sources.</p>\r\n<p>Thus the Atlas eliminates all the guessing and the fantasies we used to encounter when reciting the Noble Quran, and takes us to the specific place.</p>\r\n<h3>Publisher\'s Note</h3>\r\n<p>The Noble Qur\'an is the last Divine Book which has been revealed by Allah for the guidance of mankind up to the Day of Resurrection. One of the bright sides of this Book is that it is read and recited much more than any other book of the world. In a real sense this very Book has encircled into it the ever shining pearls of all the visible and invisible knowledge and the wisdom, the world needs for survival and eternal success. Hence the reading of the Qur\'an, understanding of its meanings and interpretations is important and obligatory on all the followers of Islam.</p>\r\n<p>Muslim Community should be proud for having the last Divine Book in a well-preserved form. This blessed opportunity has not been provided to any other heavenly religion. Before the revelation of the Qur\'an, hundred of Scriptures including the three former heavenly Books as well have been annihilated. Whatever they have at hand as they disclose are nothing but only the Collections of narratives and sayings of spiritual guides. On the other hand, today the Noble Qur\'an has its originality as it was, in the hearts of thousands of the memorizers (Huffaz) of the Qur\'an. As regards to its manuscripts written from time to time in various periods, their samples are available even today and found in museums, government under-taken libraries as well as many of the private libraries and various publication institutes at large scales. After revelation of the Qur\'an, various artifice skills developed. Besides its modulation forms, some of them pertained to its literal terms - explanatory points, religious decrees, themes, topic and issue discussions etc. But along with these skills, other techniques and arts such as calligraphy, designing, printing, binding, etc., also developed.</p>\r\n<p>Later on the reference of the Qur\'anic geography, descriptions of the Prophets, the Qur\'anic habitations, the Qur\'anic landmarks etc., were described in scores of the books, by the end of 20th century. But in the third millennium of the world civilization, these descriptions appeared on surface in the form of a new way of \'understanding the Qur\'an\'. For the first time an effort has been made to bring out the places, the same time, I decided, considering it a valuable presentation, that our institution, Darussalam, would certainly bring out its Urdu and English editions.</p>\r\n<p>So, a contact was made with Dar Al-Fikr, Damascus - the publisher of Atlas of the Qur\'an, but they refused. Then some common friends were asked to do something in this regard, and the publisher was addressed through a letter also, but nothing could be finalized. Last year, Mr. Hasan Salim, the son of Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim, owner of Dar Al-Fikr, came to Riyadh. He visited the offices of Darussalam and was very much impressed after knowing about the aims and objects of Darussalam and its efforts for the spread of Islamic knowledge, he promised to have a talk with his father regarding the publication of the Atlas of the Qur\'an.</p>\r\n<p>In the beginning of the year 2003, 1 specially went to Damascus, which is like a second home to me. In the past ten or twelve years, I must have gone there at least 30 or 35 times. In Damascus, the second name of Darussalam is Darul Fika\'. Its owner, Mr. Muhammad Yasir Tabba\' is dear to me like a younger brother. After reaching Damascus, I informed my hosts that the only purpose of my visit is to have a conversation with Dar Al-Fikr regarding the books Atlas of the Qur\'an and the Atlas on the Prophet\'s Biography. The next day we were at the offices of Dar Al-Fikr. Mr. Hasan Salim greeted me heartily. I started talking him about the books again. He proposed to have a talk with his father who was a very busy person. I asked for a few minutes talk with him. His secretary agreed to allow us time for a short talk reminding about the appointments previously assigned.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting that was scheduled to be of a short duration, exceeded one hour and a half until the secretary of Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim interrupted to remind about the visitors that were waiting.</p>\r\n<p>Dar Al-Fikr was established 50 years ago. Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim has passed 70 years of life, having a very good health by the grace of Allah and running the organization with full enthusiasm. He told me about the visit of Maulana Maudoodi to Damascus in 1960 and that the Maulana paid a visit to his house for a social call. Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim had arranged a dinner for his reception and invited prominent scholars and writers in it. We were engrossed in the past memories. He has a wide experience of publishing books and is personalities and nations etc., as indicated in the Qur\'an, in the form of a unique presentation comprising maps, photographs and tables. This great endeavor is Atlas of the Qur\'an by a prominent research scholar of geography and an Arabian renowned figure, Dr Shawqi Abu Khalil. For the interpretation and explanation of the religious books, the ancient and modern orientalists have done a notable work, and whatever work they did, it is of course a landmark for other research scholars. The habitations and personalities mentioned in Torah, or the land marks, places and personalities mentioned in four books of New Testament are available (in a beautiful manner) in more than a dozen geographical books with maps, known as atlas. But in various chapters of the Qur\'an, the descriptions replete with the events of the Hijaz, Arab nations, places, personalities, oceans, rivers, gulfs, lakes, mountains, forests, caves, cities etc., are available and hundreds of the writers, scholars and authors have also gone through their details, and many of the research books have also been compiled on these topics, but on the other hand, all this fruitful information has yet not been presented in the form of a book (atlas) consisting of maps, photographs and tables. These concerned contents or literary compositions containing the Qur\'anic maps and tables were not before me so that a reciter of the Qur\'an may think of the details of the indications found in the Qur\'an while reciting it.</p>\r\n<p>Since the dawn of the establishment of Darussalam, the multilingual institution for the publication of the Qur\'an and the Qur\'anic sciences and ideologies, we have been on the line of our objectives, i.e., the circulation & publication of the Qur\'an in various languages with its ideologies in scientific manner. In this regard, we keeping in view the modern opportunities, are applying all kinds of modern scientific means and techniques in the teaching & the publication of the Qur\'an. Being an ordinary student of the Qur\'an, it has been my sincere effort to bring out the books (published in Arabic language) on teaching of the Qur\'an, teaching of Hadith, biography of the Messenger into the Urdu, English and other languages. Then after two and half years ago, when I went through the great work: (Atlas of the Qur\'an: Places, Nations, Landmarks) by the distinguished author of Arabic language, Dr Shawqi Abu Khalil, I found it adorned with colored maps besides the Qur\'anic topics and Verses. I was happily surprised and impressed after looking through its pages, and then at<br />well known in the Islamic world. He provided me valuable guidance as regards the publishing field.</p>\r\n<p>However, this meeting ended upon the permission to print both of the books. It was decided that Darussalam will pay regular royalty on them and some money will be paid as advance. Thanks are to Allah that after some weeks when he visited Riyadh to participate in a conference of writers, an agreement was signed between us, and so I was able to fulfill the wish I was most eager of. I am thankful to Mr. Muhammad Adrian Salim for his cooperation and permission to publish the translations of the books.</p>\r\n<p>It may be perceived that the compilation of the Qur\'anic Atlas consisting of personalities, nations, events and landmarks, places etc., as mentioned in the Qur\'an, was not an easier task. Certainly the author might have made a journey toward the passed period, and imaginarily perceived the pictures of the events mentioned in the Noble Qur\'an. It seems in the journey to the past, other heavenly books, history, narratives and the modern archaeological studies were also proved helpful to this great writer. Certainly this journey in the back direction consisting of several periods would have been a typical and unique experience of his life, but this experience itself is one of the best rewards of the struggles the author did. Having a dip in the ocean of this beautiful experience, the writer has compiled both of his atlases. I am sure that both of them would open for the readers the channel of intelligence and spiritual journey which the author found.</p>\r\n<p>Now the work on the other valuable presentation: Atlas on the Prophet\'s Biography is under process, and Insha Allah with high standards of printing and designing, it will soon be in the hands of the readers.</p>\r\n<p>The readers are humbly requested to accept from us this unique presentation, and pray to Allah for us to be more active in the struggle towards the multilingual publications of much needed books, treatises etc., based on Islam.<br />May Allah bless us with splendid success.</p>\r\n<p><em>Abdul-Malik Mujahid</em><br />General Manager Darussalam, Riyadh, KSA</p>','An Authentic Collection of the Qur\'anic Information with Maps, Tables and Pictures.',1,'0',0,'31','2013-07-08 09:56:55',2,'2013-07-08 09:57:39',2),(725,'Basic Principles of Islam','Basic-Principles-of-Islam',57,'<p>Following most basic and important topics about Islam are explained in this book in a very simple way:<br />Islam</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Islam</li>\r\n<li>Allah</li>\r\n<li>Prophet Muhammad (Allah\'s peace & blessings upon him)</li>\r\n<li>Iman (Belief)</li>\r\n<li>The Noble Quran</li>\r\n<li>The Five Pillars of Islam: Shahadah, Prayer, Zakat, Fasting, Hajj (Pilgrimage)</li>\r\n<li>The Mosque</li>\r\n<li>Manners of a Muslim</li>\r\n</ol>','This small colorful booklet goes over all the basics of Islam.

Then we covered some events that the Prophet prophesized about and that have already taken place before our century. When we gave an account of events that took place after the Prophet\\\'s death, we pointed out those occurrences about which a Hadith gave information.

He is the God of Prophet Moses (pbuh), Prophet Jesus (pbuh), Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and all the other Prophets. The name \'Allah\' is not a new name, but rather the true name of God. It is used by Muslims as well as Arabic-speaking Christians.</p>\r\n<p>... and say: \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you (Jews and Christians); our God and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted (as Muslims).\" (Qur\'an, 29:46)</p>\r\n<h3>What is the Qur\'an?</h3>\r\n<p>The Qur\'an is the literal Word of Allah revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), through the angel Gabriel, about fourteen hundred years ago. The Qur\'an is the eternal miracle of Islam. Allah has challenged mankind to produce anything to match it or even match one short chapter of it, yet no human has ever been able to meet the challenge.</p>\r\n<p>And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a chapter of the like thereof, and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah if you are truthful. (Qur\'an, 2:23)</p>\r\n<p>Since the Qur\'an is the literal Word of Allah, it exists only in its original Arabic in which it was revealed, and cannot be translated into another language. However, for the benefit of those who do not speak Arabic, the meanings of the Qur\'an can be translated. Therefore, the quotations in this book are not the Qur\'an but only translations of its meanings.</p>\r\n<h3>What Does the Word \'Islam\' Mean?</h3>\r\n<p>The word \'Islam\' means the conscious and peaceful obedience and submission to the Will of the only true God, \'Allah\'. All religions were named either after their founders or after nations or tribes e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Christianity, while the name \'Islam\' is not associated with any person, tribe or nation but was given by Allah in the Qur\'an:</p>\r\n<p>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. (Qur\'an, 5:3)</p>\r\n<p>The word \'Muslim\' is a description; anyone who submits himself to Allah\'s Will and obeys Him is a Muslim.<br />All the Prophets were Muslims because they obeyed Allah and submitted themselves to His Will. Furthermore, the true followers and companions of those Prophets were Muslims:</p>\r\n<p>Then when Jesus came to know of their disbelief, he said: \"Who will be my helpers in Allah\'s cause?\" The disciples said: \"We are the helpers of Allah (i.e. we will strive in His cause); we believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to Allah). Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down and we follow the Messenger (Jesus) SO write us down among those who bear witness.\" (Qur\'an, 3:52, 53)</p>\r\n<p>Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all people to Jesus - the son of Mary. The Prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one (Islamic Monotheism).\" (Bukhari)</p>\r\n<h3>Early Muslims</h3>\r\n<p>Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and all the other Prophets from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them) were sent with the same Message, to command human beings to worship Allah alone, and<br />not to join in worship partners with him. Prophet Jesus (pbuh) never claimed divinity. He taught the Oneness of Allah and confirmed that he was just a Messenger:</p>\r\n<p>Jesus said, \"... I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my. God and your God.\" (John 20:17)<br />By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. (John 5:30)</p>\r\n<p>The disciples followed the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). They worshiped Allah alone and kept religion pure for Him. They believed and supported Prophet Jesus (pbuh) to such an extent that Allah held them up as an excellent example to Muslims in the Qur\'an:</p>\r\n<p>O you who believe! Be you helpers (in the cause) of Allah as said Jesus - son of Mary, to the disciples: \"Who will be my helpers in Allah\'s cause?\" The disciples said: \"We are the helpers of Allah (i.e. we will strive in His cause)! Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So, We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the victorious. (Qur\'an, 61:14)</p>\r\n<p>Jesus the merciful Prophet (pbuh) commanded his disciples to be kind and merciful and to forgive others. Let the Qur\'an now describe the followers of Prophet Jesus (pbuh):</p>\r\n<p>Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent Jesus - son of Mary, and gave him the Injeel (Gospel), and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. (Qur\'an, 57:27)</p>\r\n<p>Verily, you will find the strongest among mankind in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are idolaters and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say: \"We are Christians.\" That is because amongst them are priests and monks, and they are not arrogant. (Qur\'an, 5:82)</p>\r\n<p>After the Ascension of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) to heaven, most of the Christians remained Unitarian. They used to believe in the Oneness of Allah following the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and all the other Prophets. They did not believe in the doctrines of Trinity, Original Sin, Blood Atonement or Divine Sonship of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). After centuries of persecution against the Unitarian Christians, the Pauline Church prevailed and the teachings of Paul replaced the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and Paul became the real founder of today\'s Christianity.</p>\r\n<p>Paul, the self-appointed thirteenth apostle who never saw Jesus (pbuh), wrote more Books of the Bible than any other author, while Prophet Jesus (pbuh) did not write a single word, as the original Gospel revealed by Allah to Jesus (pbuh) was lost. However, Paul replaced the Gospel of Jesus (pbuh) with a gospel written by him and invented the doctrines of Original Sin, Blood Atonement and Divine Sonship of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). With the exception of few verses, all the verses in Paul\'s letters are his own words and not the words of Prophet Jesus (pbuh):</p>\r\n<p>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to my (Paul) gospel. (2 Timothy 2:8) (KJV) After the loss of the original Gospel of Prophet Jesus (pbuh), many gospels were written. These gospels include some of the genuine teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) mixed with people\'s own texts and interpretations which were influenced by the beliefs of that period. Therefore, it became difficult and sometimes impossible to know which parts came from Allah and which from people. As a result, Christians deviated from the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and followed the teachings of hundreds of monks and priests which resulted in hundreds of religious groups having different beliefs.</p>\r\n<h3>The Effects of the Contradictions in the Bible</h3>\r\n<p>The errors and contradictions in the Bible make some Christians reject Christianity and view the Bible as merely a historical book. Those people continue their disbelief to the extent that they deny the existence of God and consequently, they do not believe in all the Prophets including Prophet Jesus (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>Those people shock the Muslim more than anyone else, because no Muslim is a Muslim if he or she does not believe in Jesus Christ (pbuh). The Muslim, in compliance with the Qur\'an, believes that Jesus (pbuh) was a great Messenger of Allah, that he brought the dead to life by Allah\'s leave, that he healed those born blind and the lepers by Allah\'s leave, that he was born without any male intervention and that he was the Christ.</p>\r\n<p>It is true that the errors and contradictions in the Bible mean that the Word of Allah has been mixed with people\'s texts and interpretations. However, they do not mean that Prophet Jesus (pbuh) was a liar or that Allah does not exist! They do not mean that Muhammad (pbuh) was a false prophet or that Islam is not the true religion!</p>\r\n<h3>The Purpose of this Book</h3>\r\n<p>The purpose of this book is to achieve the following objectives using the Qur\'an and what survived in the Bible from the teachings of the Prophets (peace be upon them), with the help of our common sense, reason and intellect:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To confirm that Prophet Jesus (pbuh) was a great Messenger of Allah, that he was the Christ, that he was given the Gospel, that he was born miraculously without a father and that he gave life to the dead by Allah\'s leave and healed him who was born blind and the leper by Allah\'s leave.</li>\r\n<li>To confirm that the original Gospel revealed to Prophet Jesus (pbuh) was lost and that the existing gospels include few parts of that original Gospel mixed with people\'s texts and interpretations, which contain a lot of errors and contradictions.</li>\r\n<li>To disprove misrepresentations and lies in the Bible against Allah.</li>\r\n<li>To disprove false charges in the Bible against the Prophets, Lot, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, and Job (peace be upon them).</li>\r\n<li>To disprove false charges in the Bible against Prophet Jesus (pbuh).</li>\r\n<li>To point out the wrong beliefs which were added (intentionally or unintentionally) into the message of Prophet Jesus (pbuh).

To prove that Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) was the awaited Prophet prophesied in the Bible.</li>\r\n<li>To present the real Islam through the Qur\'an and remove lies and misrepresentations wrapped around Islam by its enemies.</li>\r\n</ul>','This book compares Islam and Christianity according to a comparative study of the Bible and the Quran.',1,'0',0,'44','2013-07-11 06:34:25',2,'2013-07-11 07:03:15',2),(741,'Cleanliness is from Faith','Cleanliness-is-from-Faith',57,'<h3>Publisher\'s Note</h3>\r\n<p>Allah, the Most High loves the person who is clean, and people respect him. This is because cleanliness is a part of Faith. Faith has levels, and the highest of them is the statement \"None has the right to be worshipped except Allah,\" while the lowest of them is removing harmful things from the road.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, cleanliness is from the matters which Islam encourages to be maintained. Thus Islam has legislated for us ablution for every prayer, and bathing for Jumu\'ah (Friday) and the \'Eids (celebrations). Islam calls upon us to be clean of body, heart and mind, in our homes, our gatherings, and the road. Our Messenger, Muhammad (pbuh), was the best example of cleanliness.

And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun (good doers).\" (29:69)</li>\r\n<li>\"And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death).\" (15:99)</li>\r\n<li>\"And remember the Name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with a complete devotion.\" (73:8)</li>\r\n<li>\"So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it.\" (99:7)</li>\r\n<li>\"And whatever good you send before you for yourselves, (i.e., Nawafil - non-obligatory acts of worship: prayers, charity, fasting, Hajj and Umrah etc.), you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward\" (73:20)</li>\r\n<li>\"And whatever you spend in good, Allah knows it well.\" (2:273)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Hadith 95:</h3>\r\n<p>Narrated Abu Hurairah (ra) Messenger (pbuh) said, \"Allah the Exalted has said: \'I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him.\"\' [Al-Bukhari]</p>\r\n<h3>Commentary:</h3>\r\n<p>Those who make innovations in religion and associate partners with Allah (such as Haluli -who believe in the indwelling light in the soul of man, Wajudi - who believe in the physical form of Allah, and pagans who worship other than Allah) interpret this Hadith in support of their base contention and thus seek support of one wrong from another although the meaning and interpretation of the Hadith is not at all what the describe. In simple and unambiguous terms, the Hadith means that when a person adds voluntary prayers to the obligatory ones, he becomes a favorite slave of Allah and on account of it, he receives special help from Allah. Then he is protected by Allah to the extent that He supervises every organ of his body. Thus, he is saved from disobedience of Allah. He bears what is hiked by Allah, sees what is liked by Him, handles what pleases Him. When he attains that lofty position of love and obedience of Allah then Allah in return also grants prayers of His obedient and loyal slaves.</p>\r\n<p>A saint is not one who has a peculiar get up and appearance, or who occupies the seat of a saint as his successor, or a person who is lost in meditation, or a half-mad, or one who has invented his own style of remembrance and worship of Allah, but it is one who strictly fulfills the obligations imposed by Islam, is fond of voluntary prayers and adheres to Divine injunctions in every walk of life.</p>\r\n<p>The love of such saints is a means to attain the Pleasure of Allah, and enmity (hatred and repulsion) with them is a cause of His serious displeasure and wrath.</p>\r\n<p>Voluntary prayer is certainly a means of attaining the Pleasure of Allah, but it must be preceded by the fulfillment of obligatory prayers. The former is of no value if the latter is neglected. The desire to attain nearness of Allah without strict observance of the obligatory prayers is fallacious and meaningless</p>\r\n<h3>Hadith 96:</h3>\r\n<p>Narrated Anas (ra): The Prophet (pbuh) said, \"Allah says: \'When a slave of Mine draws near to Me a span, I draw near to him a cubit; and if he draws near to Me a cubit, I draw near to him a fathom.

Once during the training when the Prophet asked about the strategy to adopt in the battle, one of his Companion, \'Asim bin Thabit (R) had stood up with his bow in his hand and replied:</p>\r\n<p>\"When the enemy is a hundred yards away, we will use our bows and arrows; when the enemy comes closer, we will fight with our spears; when the spears break, we will have a hand to hand combat with our swords.\"</p>\r\n<p>When the Prophet (pbuh) heard this, he said:</p>\r\n<p>\"Doubtless this was the way to fight a battle. Whoever wishes to take part in a battle should adopt the strategy of \'Asim bin Thabat.\"</p>\r\n<p>These great martial Commanders improved upon and developed the strategies and principles first enunciated by the Prophet (pbuh). They loved death more than life in their pursuit of the righteous and true religion, therefore sometimes the opposing forces were ten times larger than the Muslim army and with superior arms, yet most often it were the forces of Islam which were victorious. Therefore the Prophet (pbuh) gave some of them the title of Saifullah (Sword of Allah) and the title of Lion of Allah.</p>\r\n<p>After the death of the Prophet (pbuh), the empire of Islam spread over an area of ten hundred thousand square miles.

These were the warriors who after a vigorous training had turned to pure gold after being trained by the supreme Commander, the mercy to mankind, and the embodiment of goodness, the king of Al Madinah, Muhammad (pbuh). Experts in the art of war were amazed and overwhelmed when they studied their exploits of bravery and valor. They struck terror in the hearts of the enemy and the stronghold sand palaces of Qaesar and Kisra trembled before their might.</p>\r\n<p>They lived in austerity and simplicity, yet their style was regal. They were not cowed down by the enemy, they did not tremble before him in terror, neither could they be deterred from the pursuit of their objective. They loved death more than life in their pursuit of the righteous and true. Their gaze was modest, their hearts burned with passionate love of Allah Almighty, their arms were powerful and their feet stood surprisingly firm and steady as they fought for what their conscience told them was moral and virtuous. In whichever direction they turned, they conquered region after region. Under the leadership of the Prophet (pbuh) they performed stunning deeds of valor and daring in the battlefields. In no time at all the stories of their great and noble exploits became the assurances of their bravery and the tales of their heroism were guarantees of their fervor and ardor. These epic stories spread in all directions. The battles fought during the Prophet\'s time were the most excellent and exemplary in all respects. Many time the forces of Islam faced armies which were much larger. Sometimes the opposing forces were ten times larger than the Prophet\'s army, and also had a larger number of superior arms and equipment, yet most often it was the forces of Islam which were victorious. Sociologists are amazed by the fact that the Islamic state started off as a small city state and, expanded at an average rate of two hundred square miles per day. Ten years later at the death of the Prophet (pbuh) the empire of Islam was spread over an area of ten hundred thousand square miles.</p>\r\n<p>When one studies the Islamic era spanning the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) from the point of view of conquest and occupation of lands, their organization, management and administration, this amazement subsides. Every stage and step seems to have been patterned according to a well-defined, comprehensive and well thought out plan.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&nbsp;Stability of the conquered lands.</li>\r\n<li>Education, moral and religious training of the conquered peoples.</li>\r\n<li>The education and training of the managers and administrators in morals, intellect and skills.</li>\r\n<li>An attempt to extend the limits of the Islamic Empire, by training military experts. This training was moral and intellectual. Technical know - how was not neglected either. Under their leadership the Islamic army forged their way into new territories in all directions; these were basic, innovative and revolutionary steps that resulted in astounding exploits. As a result within the short span of fifteen years after the passing away of the Prophet (pbuh) most of the areas of the two major continents of Asia and Africa, were under the control of the Muslims.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When a student of Islamic history observes these facts, he is inevitably and deeply interested to learn about the lives of these remarkable military leaders. He would like to study their characters, their code of life and the strategies they employed. He would like to gain enlightenment from these beacons of the past in order to illuminate such light as make the world of Islam shine in the present, and also to blaze a trail for future generations.</p>\r\n<p>Human nature and the basic strategies of war normally do not change; it is for this reason that invaluable lessons can be gained even from the battles fought far back in ancient recorded history. With this purpose in mind biographical sketches of these great generals of the early years of Islam are being presented; their incredible and extraordinary military achievements have added many a glorious and golden chapter to the history of mankind.</p>\r\n<p>Doubtless those great personalities who were trained by the greatest Commander of Arab and Ajam, the Sultan of Al-Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh) himself, had been transformed by personal contact with his radiant personality. Their eyes witnessed his greatness, which had become the axis of their hearts souls and very existence. The only meaning and purpose of their lives was to achieve martyrdom in the cause of Islam. A study of the enviable lives and characters of these great generals will inspire modern day Mujdhideen<sup>[1]</sup> soldiers and military leaders with the spirit of sacrifice and Jihad<sup>[2]</sup>. The battles fought during the life of the Prophet (pbuh) introduced and made crystal-clear such principles of military strategy as had never been used in human history. The brilliance of the strategies the Prophet (pbuh) used as the Commander-in-Chief in the battle of Badr cannot be or ignored even in the context of modern day warfare. The very first martial tactics employed by the small Islamic State in its infancy were remarkably well organized and disciplined, for the example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Before leaving for the battlefield a Deputy was appointed in Al-Madinah.</li>\r\n<li>The Muslim army was divided into different groups or divisions and a commander was appointed for each of these divisions.</li>\r\n<li>Qais Al Mazni Ansari was appointed to watch over the rear section of the army.</li>\r\n<li>The Muslim army reached the battlefield of Badr first and took control of the stream there, so that the enemy could not face the Muslim army for long without water.</li>\r\n<li>Even before the battle started, it was realized that the group formation of the Muslim army should be given a great deal of attention. This was because the opposing army outnumbered them three to one.</li>\r\n<li>After the formation the Prophet (pbuh) ordered that no Mujahid should take any step on his own, and must wait for orders from him.</li>\r\n<li>He ordered that the Mujahideen should shoot their arrows only when the enemy came within range; if he was beyond their range they should not shoot. This was to avoid wastage of arms and equipment. If the enemy was very close then they should fight with their spears; if they were even closer then they should use their swords to defend themselves.</li>\r\n<li>On one occasion he pointed out to his army that they should be aware that the most effective strength and strategy lay in the practice of Rummi. This meant to practice the art of throwing. This covers all kinds of weapons of war, which are either thrown or shot. Missiles, bombs or cannons from which shots are fired - all belong to this category of weapons. Even in the changed war scenario of today, the principle of Rummi is of prime importance; as this is where the real strength of an army lies. This principle and its significant contribution to the victory and might of a military force was first enunciated by the Prophet (pbuh). The degree of superiority and dominance of one country over another is in direct proportion to its strength and power.</li>\r\n<li>In the battle of Badr a special covered platform was erected for the Prophet , at the rear of the place where the army was deployed. The rules and principles of warfare were promulgated and declared. Women, children, people not taking part in active warfare and all senior citizens were not to be killed or harmed in any way.</li>\r\n<li>In the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (pbuh), inspected the battlefield and</li>\r\n<li>sensing the various possibilities of danger, posted a squad of fifty archers on a mountain. They were ordered to stick to their positions under all circumstances. The vital importance of this positioning was realized when the enemy, finding this strategic position unoccupied unexpectedly attacked the Muslim army and caused significant damage.</li>\r\n<li>In the battle of Ahzab, the digging of the trenches gave total protection from the enemy to Islam\'s first capital, Al-Madinah. This innovative and unusual move of digging trenches around a city for the purpose of protecting it astonished Abu Sufyan, the Commander of the enemy forces. Trenches are today an integral and important part of defensive fortification strategy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;All these steps enumerated above were basically innovative military strategies, which were probably introduced for the first time in human history. This book recounts the amazing exploits of the great heroes who led the first Islamic forces in battle, and had been trained by the Prophet (pbuh). An experienced enemy and leader like Wrath Abu Sufyan had been nonplused by these innovative measures. These great martial heroes of Islam improved upon and developed the strategies and principles first enunciated by the Prophet. Even in a state of war they did not lose sight of the great moral and ethical values taught them by the Prophet (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>Pray to Allah Almighty that He grant abundant Divine Guidance to the military experts, generals, the young soldiers and Mujahideen to follow in the footsteps of these great Companions and generals and bring back the past glories of Islam.</p>\r\n<p>May Allah Almighty Shower His Blessings on the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mahmood Ahmad Ghadanfar</strong></p>\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n<p><sup><span>[1]</span></sup>&nbsp;Mujdhideen - Those who fight in a war for Islam.

Abu Al-Fida\' \'Imad Ad-Din Isma\'il bin \'Umar bin Kathir Al-Qurashi Al-Busrawi (d. 774 H.), is the most popular interpretation of the Qur\'an in the Arabic language, and the majority of the Muslims consider it to be the best source based on Qur\'an and Sunnah. This Arabic work spans three thousand and two hundred pages in four volumes. To cover all of the references, Ibn Kathir has also collected some weak Ahadith and Israelitish stories. Some repetitions also occur in it, as and when the topics required these.</p>\r\n<p>As Darussalam has made a policy to publish only such works which are based on Qur\'an and authentic Ahadith we appointed a board of Islamic scholars to summarize Tafsir Ibn Kathir in the original Arabic language. Shaykh Abu Al-Ashbal Ahmad Shagif of Rabitah Al-\'Alam Al-Islami, Makkah, and Shaykh Safi-ur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri, Head of the Research Committee of Darussalam worked with a team of other scholars for about two years on this project. We published this summarized version in the Arabic language titled as Al-Misbah Al-Murur fe Tahdhib Tafsir Ibn Kathir.</p>\r\n<p>This summarized version was prepared for the sole purpose of translation into all the major languages of the world. First of all, it is being presented in the English language as it is the most widely written and spoken in the world.</p>\r\n<p>To translate a book in another language is a task requiring great skill, and when it comes to the translation of Tafsir and Hadith, then it becomes a greater responsibility, requiring the skills of both languages and the knowledge of religion and religious terms. The help, advice, guidance and cooperation of many persons was sought for the various steps of the project. The translation was done by Mr. Jalal Abualrub (USA), Mr. Nasir Khitab, his wife Mrs. Huda Khitab (Canada), Mr. Aqeel Walker (USA), Dr. Muhammad Al-Jibali (USA) and Mr. Sami Ayoub (USA). The translation was edited by Mr. Abu Khaliyl (USA), Mr. Muhammad Farooq (Pakistan), Mr. Abdul Ahad (India) Mrs. Jalal Abualrub (USA), Mr. Abdul-Mun\'im (Egypt), Mr. Sidheeque M.A. Veliankode (India). Qari Muhammad Iqbal (Pakistan), Mr. Shakil Ahmad As-Salafi (India) and Hafiz Abdul-Matin (Pakistan). Layout planning and computer programming in an advanced publishing software was voluntarily carried out by Mr. Muhammad Munawar (Pakistan).</p>\r\n<p>The typesetting and correction of manuscript was done by Mr. Abdus-Samad (India), Syed Ali Haider (India) and Mr. Hassan Ajami (Egypt). Some valuable suggestions were made by Mr. AlArabi bin Razduq (UK) and Mr. Omar Johnson (USA).</p>\r\n<p>We have tried our best not to include any weak Hadith in this presentation. All the authentic sayings of the Prophet (S) have also been presented in the Arabic language along with diacritics. The only sections of the Arabic that were not translated are some discussions pertaining to Arabic words which were not pertinent to the English readers, such omissions are very few to mention. Topic headings were added throughout the Tafsir to help the readers better understand the discussion of the Verses of the Qur\'an. The language and style adopted for the translation is very plain and simple. The translation of the meanings of the Verses is from the translation of Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan published by Darussalam. The editors have made some changes in it at some places where it was necessary to comply with the Tafsir.</p>\r\n<p>I am thankful to all the workers, helpers and advisers who cooperated with us in the completion of this great project. And I am especially thankful to Shaykh Safi-ur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri, who is a great scholar of the time and from whom all of us at Darussalam benefit seeking his advice and valuable suggestions regarding our research projects and problems. We have tried our best to make it a faultless work, but human weakness may render any error in it. We ask the readers to forgive us for such errors and to inform us of that in order to remove it from the following editions.</p>\r\n<p>In the whole project, the errors are from our side and from Satan while all the good is from the blessings of Allah. If the people benefit from this translation in the understanding of the Qur\'an, we will consider it a great blessing and we pray to Allah for the best reward in the Hereafter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul-Malik Mujahid</strong><br /> <em>General Manager, Darussalam Publications<br /> Riyadh, March 2000</em></p>','Tafsir Ibn Kathir is one of the Most Comprehensive Explanation of the Noble Quran.

We seek refuge in Allah from the evil of our own selves and our wicked deeds. Whomsoever Allah guides, none can lead astray; and whomsoever Allah leaves astray, none can guide. And I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah alone, and He has no partner; and I bear witness that our Prophet Muhammad is His servant and Messenger. May Allah, send peace and blessings upon him, his family and his Companions until the Day of judgment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Indeed Allah Almighty has protected this religion and raised its status among the nations, sending to the world the final Messenger, Muhammad, and with him the final and most complete religion - as Allah Almighty says:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Allah Almighty has made the scholars inheritors of the Prophets; they explain to the people their religious duties and they enlighten them, so that their worship of Allah Almighty is based on knowledge and insight. One such scholar, whom the Muslims recently lost, is the noble Shaikh and Imam, \'Abdul-\'Aziz bin \'Abdullah bin Baz - may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, for he spent his life in knowledge, in teaching, in passing scholarly judgments and rulings. But over and above his knowledge, he was a man who was righteous and pious; he sought little from this world, and his manners were truly noble. From the many works in which the Shaikh served the different branches of Islamic knowledge - \'<em>Aqidah, Fiqh, Hadith, Da\'wah,</em><span class=\"apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>and so on - is this very important work, Important Lessons For Every Muslim, a book that is much needed at the present time because so many Muslims lack a grasp on the fundamentals of the religion, in terms of belief, worship, and manners.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Seeking reward, seeking to benefit others, and seeking to apply the Hadith:<br /> The best of people is he who benefits others most.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I decided to explain this important book, expanding on the clear concepts and rules mentioned by the Shaikh. In explaining and expanding on the Shaikh\'s words, I relied heavily, first upon Allah Almighty, and then upon the many other works of the Shaikh himself.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I chose to explain the copy printed by the Ministry of Islamic Affairs, Endowments, Preaching and Guidance; it is the last edition that was printed during the life of the Shaikh - may Allah have mercy upon him. I chose it because it is the best copy in terms of organization and editing; moreover, it has an additional section on the topic of Ihsan.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>To further help and encourage the reader - whether he is a student, teacher, caller to Islam, male, or female - I inserted questions for each lesson (at the end of the book), to help the student both understand and digest the material.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>I ask Allah Almighty by His Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to rectify our intentions and to make our children righteous, and to grant us sincerity in speech and in deed; indeed, He is the One upon Whom we rely, and He is Most Capable of answering our prayers. And the last of our supplications is that all praise is due to Allah, the Lord of all that exists.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><strong>Muhammad bin \'Ali Al-\'Arfaj</strong><br /> <em>(May Allah forgive him, his parents, and all Muslims)</em></span></p>','This book is a short work to explain what every Muslim needs to know about the religion of Islam.',1,'0',0,'23','2013-07-18 05:55:49',2,'2013-07-18 06:06:23',2),(770,'Faith in Predestination (Qada Wa Qadar)','Faith-in-Predestination-(Qada-',57,'<p>Belief in predestination (Qada wa Qadar) is an undisputed article of faith in Islam. For some people, this belief leads to contentment and satisfaction, even in the face of hardship and adversity. But for others, it provides justification for their wrongdoing: how often do we hear people arguing that they should not be blamed for their disobedience since it has already be decreed by Allah that they will sin?</p>\r\n<p>The following two articles in this booklet attempt to answer those people who genuinely wonder whether Man has any control over his actions in this life or whether he is forced to do everything that he does.</p>\r\n<p>The first article was originally compiled in Arabic by Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Salih Al-Uthaimin, a renowned scholar from Saudi Arabia; the second was a reply by Mr. Adil Salahi to a question which appeared on the religious pages of the daily \"Arab News\" of Jeddah.</p>','It is hoped that this booklet will help to clarify the difficult issue of pre-destination.',1,'0',0,'59','2013-07-18 06:24:15',2,'2013-07-18 06:24:15',2),(771,'Fast according to the Quran & Sunnah','Fast-according-to-the-Quran-&-',57,'<p>Saum (Fast) is a third Pillar of Islam.

The legal Islamic rulings required should be from those who have knowledge of Qur\'anic Verses and Ahadith, and be able to understand them and to use them as evidence as required on the questions. They must possess knowledge to the extent that they are able to cite relevant Ahadith on which there is consensus. They must have sufficient knowledge of the Arabic language to understand the texts of the Qur\'an and the Sunnah and to derive and extract proofs from them. It is not easy for the Muslims to contact such learned scholars of Islam at all times for legal judgements they are in need of at particular times.</p>\r\n<p>To overcome this difficulty of the Muslims, Darussalam is presenting this collection of legal rulings issued from the most renowned scholars of the world.

Whomsoever Allah guides, there is none to misguide him and whomsoever He leaves astray, there is none who can guide him. And I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger, may the peace of Allah and bountiful blessings be upon him and upon his family and Companions. As for what follows:</p>\r\n<p>Some brothers, may Allah reward them with goodness, have expressed a desire to see some of the questions related to the pillars of Islam which were asked of our Shaikh, the most learned Shaikh, Muhammad bin Salih Al-\'Uthaimeen may Allah, the Most High bless him. The hope was for them to be published in the Arabic language and following that, to be translated into many different languages in order to spread the benefit of them. Indeed, these verdicts are distinguished by their reliance upon the Book of Allah, the Most High, the Sunnah of His Messenger (pbuh), and the opinions of the scholars who are known for their investigative powers. So I put the matter to our Shaikh may Allah bless him and reward him for his support for Islam and the Muslims with the best of rewards and he welcomed the idea and encouraged it, since it was a form of mutual cooperation in encouraging the good and forbidding the evil, and of spreading Islamic knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>After His Eminence expressed his agreement and gave his advice, the process of gathering these Fatawa and selecting them from the whole collection of the Fatawa began and continued until the work was completed.</p>\r\n<p>I ask Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful by His Grace and Generosity to make this work beneficial and to make it purely for His Noble Face, and that He reward His Eminence, our Shaikh with the best of rewards, and to bless him in his knowledge, his deeds and his life-span. Verily, Allah is Beneficent and Generous.

Although one finds books on polygamy or polygyny some refuting them and some asserting them, but this presentation is quite different from them as it discusses the issue entirely in psychological and realistic ways.</p>\r\n<p>We must say that the authors have dealt with the subject covering all the aspects that had had to be discussed. They have used statistics, conducted researches, arranged interviews, provided solutions, and exposed the real attitudes in this regard. They have presented the ideal and most practical way to deal with the important issues of our life: by making the mind as the authority to decide about the matters instead of our emotions. They have shown how to analyze a situation and seek the possible ways that can produce better results. In fact, this logic of resolving the issues and solving the problems can be applied to every situation to benefit from.</p>\r\n<p>In short, the book tells us to see the facts of life in their true perspective without exaggerating or minimizing them from their actual conditions - and that is the most objective method to deal with our lives and the lives of others. We advise every man and woman to read this book and get benefited from the problem-solving approach presented in it.</p>\r\n<p>Abdul Malik Mujahid&nbsp;<br /> General Manager Darussalam</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 1.17em;\">Review by Umm Yusuf Gondekowa of Canada</span></h3>\r\n<p>Beware!

Or, to say there is no god but Allah means to not equate anything with Allah, and that everything, good and bad, comes from Allah. \'There is no god but Allah,\' is said so often that sometimes the gravity of the statement is lost and we forget what it means.</p>\r\n<p>This book takes an honest look at the emotional booby-traps of polygyny and the foremost danger is forgetting that there is no god but Allah. From personal experience, I know that when sisters discuss polygyny, conversations are fraught with phrases like, \'it\'s not for me,\' \'I couldn\'t live with such an arrangement,\' \'I would be so hurt.\' These ideas indicate that Allah was wrong when He made such a practice halal. That it might be fine for the wives of the Prophet [pbuh], but not for ourselves, because our happiness resides not in Allah, but in the monogamy of our husbands.</p>\r\n<p>From Monogamy to Polygyny gently considers the inevitable sadness, confusion and sense of loss that a wife feels when polygyny becomes a reality for her family. It also addresses climbing out of the darkness of hurt feelings coming out a stronger woman, with a stronger marriage and most importantly a stronger faith and dependence on Allah. A stronger woman because she will learn to appreciate herself and the abilities given her by Allah. A stronger marriage because she will better understand her purpose in being a wife and will, insha\'Allah, rely on her husband as a comfort from Allah, rather than the sole source of happiness and confidence in this life. A wife\'s concept of loving her husband, being a support to him for the sake of Allah, will have a true depth that will only benefit the marriage, keeping Allah indeed at the forefront. In fact, this book makes these points so well that it can inspire a sister to change her behaviour with regard to her husband, even if polygyny is not a factor in her marriage.</p>\r\n<p>No matter how many good books are written about it, polygyny is never a bed of roses initially and the authors take the time to study two examples of multiple marriage being introduced to wives. In the first example, a husband tells his wife of five years, Umm Leila, that he is considering marrying another wife. He has no particular woman in mind and isn\'t actively looking, but he feels it\'s something in his future. His wife feels that for him to consider polygyny, there must be something lacking in her. Her first thoughts are not that Allah has made this permissible to her husband and therefore there must be some benefit to her, but instead that she has the ability to make her husband so unhappy that he must seek satisfaction in a second woman.</p>\r\n<p>She writes:</p>\r\n<p>I thought he loved me. I thought he cared about me, that he wanted to be with me for the time we were on this earth together. Now I am not good enough. Now I feel like he wants to turn his back on me and love another woman. What did I do to him to make him do this to me? What am I going to do? I don\'t know how to make it to the next day. I am sick, I am tired. My energy is gone. I am no longer happy when I see him or hear him. Why has he done this to me?</p>\r\n<p>Umm Leila\'s struggle with the possibility of her husband taking another wife spans over a year, and ends in with a surprising result.</p>\r\n<p>In the second example, that of Umm Aishah, polygyny is introduced to her family after it\'s a done deal. Women finding out about their co-wives after the nikkah has been signed is very common. The husband\'s logic is his wife might dissuade him or ask for a divorce if he introduces his desire for another wife to her beforehand. Brothers might want to reconsider this strategy because then the argument becomes not one of multiple marriage, but trust between husband and wife. Better to give your wife this book first and then get married again, but since that doesn\'t happen often, Umm Aishah\'s example shows that even this pain can be overcome.</p>\r\n<p>This book offers practical advice in getting through the darkest times of multiple marriage, including a husband\'s wedding night, and getting along with co-wives. Co-wives living in harmony isn\'t always possible or even necessary, but the authors encourage wives with specific ideas on how to get along sincerely with their equals before deciding they will never be friends.</p>\r\n<p>I find the book lacking in two areas, the first in addressing the husband who takes on more wives than he can support. While the authors write from a stand point that anything can be overcome in polygyny, they do not offer recommendations to the sister who might feel abandoned financially or is otherwise treated unfairly in a true sense. Secondly, while the authors\' use Koran and ahadith to support a man\'s right to multiple wives, they ignore rights Allah has given specifically to women that could be referred to in balance. For instance the right of a woman to be supported entirely by her husband financially and her own money remaining for her own use.</p>\r\n<p>My reason for reading this book had nothing to do with polygyny. As a sister who is spending more time in the community, I was having trouble dealing with difficult personalities that I met. Who more at odds than co-wives, I thought, choosing this book and adapting the ideas in it to my concerns. I got a million times more from this book than I could have hoped and therefore I feel an obligation to recommend it to every sister, regardless of her family\'s position on multiple marriage. Polygyny is not on my family\'s radar at this time. Two months ago I might have written that it would never be a consideration, but this book has helped me correct my thinking and should it ever come up, as is my husband\'s right, I pray that I will handle the situation with grace and dignity given to me by Allah subhana wa ta\'ala. From Monogamy to Polygny: A Way Through offers help in organizing one\'s thinking to accept the qadr of Allah, which should be the greatest concern of each of us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Umm Yusuf Gondekowa, Canada</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gondekowa@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">gondekowa@gmail.com</a></p>','This book addresses the deep and complex issues and concerns the Muslim women worldwide have with polygyny.',1,'0',0,'67','2013-07-22 06:12:07',2,'2013-07-22 06:14:17',2),(783,'Furqan Visits Fez','Furqan-Visits-Fez',57,'<p>For centuries, the beautiful Moroccan city of Fez has been the cultural jewel of all northwest Africa.

Needless to say that his favorite subject is Hajj.</p>\r\n<p>Since performing his Fard Hajj in 1989, he has developed a deep desire to share his experiences and knowledge with the \"Guests of Allah\", in any way he can. In 1990 Allah blessed him with the opportunity to work in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he resided for fifteen years. This great opportunity opened the door for him to enrich his knowledge about all aspects of Hajj from the Qur\'an and Sunnah point of view. Coupled with this he was able to be close to the pilgrims, year after year, to learn about their experiences. All of this allowed him to give the reader a unique account and invaluable advice on all aspects of Hajj.</p>\r\n<p>I have reviewed the book and found it to be a serious attempt form and honest and serious Da\'ee. Through this work he has provided a good and plentiful source of information that helps the pilgrim to do the Hajj rites and rituals, from all sides and aspects in a correct way that is solid and established in the Qur\'an and Sunnah. It fulfils the needs of this everlasting excursion in modern times. It does this in a captivating way with many original ideas. It has enjoyable diversity that attracts the reader to the peaceful cities of Makkah and Madinah especially those from outside the Arabian Peninsula. More importantly, it provides authenticated proof for all Fiqh related issues.</p>\r\n<p>We ask Allah (High and Mighty) to reward the author well, give him his due reward and make this book a reserve for him. May Allah benefit all Muslims from this effort and reward everybody who contributed to it. May Allah accept from all pilgrims and visitors to the holy cities, and forgive them and us all. Aameen.

The environment, family values, knowledge, education and profession affect the mental attitude to form about life, resulting in the making of the temperament of the person.

He will found himself bound to adopt only the fair and legal ways.</p>\r\n<p>Islam has presented clear conceptions regarding life and death, likes and dislikes, forbidden and allowed, and things legal and illegal. Our pious Predecessors have tried their utmost to live life according to them. In this book, we are presenting the glimpses of their lives so as to think over our conceptions of life and mend them accordingly to what is right.

It was compiled in the Urdu language by a great scholar and a compiler of Islamic books, Mahmood Ahmad Ghadanfar, and translated by our Islamic sister Jamila Muhammad Qawi.</p>\r\n<p>This book is about the life stories of the Mothers of the believers and sixteen Prophet\'s women Companions. They were those pure and virtuous women of Islam who were honored during the very lifetime of the Prophet with the prediction that they would live forever in Paradise in the Hereafter.</p>\r\n<p>All the Mothers of the believers were of very noble character and conduct and pleased Allah so much that He sent special greeting for Khadijah (r.a) \'Aishah (r.a) , had a brilliant mind and a remarkable memory, and had the distinction of being the source of many Ahddith because of her long association with the Prophet. Her knowledge of the many branches of religion like Tafsir, Hadith, Fiqh and Shari\'ah, her wisdom in interpretation, and her mastery of the teachings of the Prophet - all these qualities made her one of the most remarkable personalities of the time.</p>\r\n<p>Female Companions were very active in religion as well as in politics and business. They were so courageous in the battlefield that their services like giving medical aid to the soldiers, nursing the wounded on the battlefields, and providing food and water to the wounded and thirsty can be found in history. They spread the message of Islam and it is proved by many of the instances that converted many of the disbelievers to Islam.</p>\r\n<p>There are many more stories like this that will encourage our Islamic sisters to get more knowledge about such great women. I hope that they will study this book thoroughly and try their best to follow these noble women of Islam.</p>\r\n<p>Pray to Allah the Almighty that He grants the writer, translator and editor and everyone else who participated by any means - the best reward in this world and in the Hereafter, for having supported in the completion of such a valuable book.

This can be achieved by taking the right preparatory steps in terms of seeking the right spouse, or the parent to be in accordance with Prophetic instructions. The warning of the Prophet (pbuh): \"If a suitor whose faith and conduct you are satisfied with comes to you, marry him your daughter. If you do not, there will be affliction on earth and gross corruption.\"</p>\r\n<p>One may wonder how could affliction and corruption ensue on a universal scale from an affair which involves only two people. This would be a valid question to be asked by those who look at marriage from a narrow perspective. This matrimonial union which involves a couple, constitutes the core of society. Its state of affairs is reflected on the society positively or negatively. A pious couple provides pious offspring with the Will of Allah. Were every guardian to insist on choosing a committed spouse, non-committed people would have no choice but to be good Muslims, otherwise, they would not find any family to associate with them. But unfortunately, wealth, lineage, social status and similar factors top the priority list for marriage.</p>\r\n<p>As for the affliction and corruption that are mentioned in the above Hadith; they are the direct result of marriages of non-committed Muslims who are not keen on raising children according to Islamic standards. We know that children learn more by example than by words. No one among us says I am a non-committed Muslim, yet telling our children what to do and not showing them by good example is the action of a non-committed Muslims. This is hypocritical and drives children to confusion and away from us. The result is that the number of such non-committed Muslims increases and affliction and corruption become rampant.</p>\r\n<p>It gives pious parents great pleasure to see their children a good Muslims and adhering to the Right Path even better than them. Similarly, they would be most miserable to see them corrupted and wretched. Thus, one must take great care of his children and seek all means that help him provide the society with God conscious members. The first and foremost means is to seek the help of Allah by supplicating to Him earnestly: &ldquo;0 our Rubb (Lord), grant us from our spouses and posterity, a source of pleasure and make us follow those before us, so that we become an example for those who will come after us.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It is for this reason we are presenting this booklet as a guideline for those parents who are concerned about their present and future offspring.

May Allah\'s peace and blessings be upon the greatest of the Prophets and Messengers - our Prophet Muhammad - and upon his Family and all of his Companions.</p>\r\n<p>One of the important factors in the development and behaviors of the societies of the world today is the impact of role models. Now, more than ever, role models are affecting the lives of all races and classes of people around the world. Because of mediums such as television, radio, telephone and the internet, many role models, such as movie stars, athletes, musicians and politicians, have become quite popular around the world.</p>\r\n<p>However, such role models do not necessarily represent the ideal style of life, practices and beliefs that are wanted for the Muslim. When Muslims look up to sinful or disbelieving people who have been portrayed in the media to be successful and famous, they began to feel inferior to them. Satan may even deceive them into feeling that the reason for the non-Muslims\' worldly success is their following of ways other than Islam.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, Darussalam has brought to life in this work the stories of some of the greatest heroes and role models of Islam. In this way we serve the cause of increasing the Muslims\' conviction to their faith. The efforts and sacrifices of these people for the sake of Allah\'s religion will show us who we are and what we really are capable of when we have strong belief in Allah.</p>\r\n<p>We thank Mr. Sidheeque M.A. Veliankode, a member of the Research Division of Darussalam for his diligent effort in publishing this work.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Heroes and Heroism</h3>\r\n<p>Every nation has its own heroes. Some are real while others are mythical. These heroes are sources of admiration, and even adoration by certain communities. In enlightened societies real heroes may be models for emulation. But who is a real hero? He is a person usually admired or respected for special qualities he is endowed with or for certain acts of bravery and chivalry.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Heroes of Islam</h3>\r\n<p>Muslims have no need to look for fictitious or mythical heroes, because their history is abundant with heroes of real flesh and blood, whose acts were heroic because of their faith, and a consequence of their attitude to life and the world. For all the heroes of Islam share two very special traits: full conviction and dedication to their pristine faith and constant attempt to seek the Pleasure of their Creator, Allah, alone, regardless of the circumstances and times they live in. For a Muslim hero, be he a military genius, a scholar teacher, or a devout common person, knows that the transient life in this world is a means to the eternal life in the Hereafter, and that ephemeral pains and pleasures are nothing compared to the everlasting pains and pleasures of Hell and Heaven. To this hero, the key to the whole thing is Divine Pleasure. Through it alone can a person enjoy peace and tranquility in this world and attain real happiness in the life hereafter.</p>\r\n<p>The Prophet (salla-Liaahu \'alayhi wa-sallam) is reported to have said: \"Strange is the case of the believer. Everything turns to his advantage only. If adversity befalls him he patiently accepts it, and is rewarded for it. If prosperity happens to him he shows gratitude to his Lord (in word and action), and is rewarded for it.\" So a hero of Islam faces both prosperity and adversity with the right attitude and action. His goal is not worldly pleasures and gains, but rather the Pleasure of Allah.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Purpose of this Book</h3>\r\n<p>In this book we will try to present glimpses of the lives of a few heroes of Islam. But they all exhibit that special quality and trait of a Muslim hero. It is my hope that the reader will find actual examples of qualities we all need to instill in ourselves and our dear ones so that Muslims may once again take their proper place and play their vital role in human civilization and history.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mahmoud Esma\'il Sieny, Ph.D.</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Professor of Applied Linguistics</em></p>','This book presents the glimpses of the lives of some of the greatest heroes and role models of Islam.',1,'0',0,'75','2013-07-26 06:09:32',2,'2013-07-26 06:11:15',2),(804,'History of Madinah Munawwarah','History-of-Madinah-Munawwarah',57,'<h3>From the Back Page</h3>\r\n<p>In this book, mention has been made about the different aspects of Al-Madinah, and the most important historical events are recorded that have direct effect on the establishment and sacredness of Al-Madinah as well as its religious weight.</p>\r\n<p>This book has highlighted the sites that are highly important whenever Al-Madinah is mentioned like the Prophet\'s Mosque, Quba Mosque and others.</p>\r\n<p>A great part of the book is designated to speak about the Prophet\'s Mosque updating the expansions and the improvements that has taken place from the time of Muhammad (pbuh) till the Saudi era.</p>\r\n<p>It contains more than fifty, pictures taken from original documented resources.

And the love of the Muslims for Al Madinah is not surprising, since the Prophet (pbuh) encouraged it, saying: \"O Allah! Make Al-Madinah beloved to us, as we love Makkah -or more.\"</p>\r\n<p>And Al-Madinah is still one of the most beloved places on earth - if not the most beloved in the heart of every Muslim, in response to this fine call. And Al-Madinah was the place to which Allah\'s Messenger emigrated and it gave him refuge, embraced his preaching and supported his religion, and its people defended him with their lives, their wealth and their sons until Allah made him victorious. So, Al-Madinah possesses virtues which are well known and an influence which none disputes in supporting this religion.</p>\r\n<p>And the land of Al-Madinah contains his pure remains and its ennoblement is increased thereby and it includes his Mosque, by which its purity is increased and its station is raised by them both and it is elevated in esteem, honor and love in the hearts of the Muslims. And all of Al-Madinah is superior, for therein deeds are multiplied (in reward) and prayer therein is equivalent to a thousand prayers in any other mosque, except the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah). And at the gates of Al-Madinah are angels, so neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal can enter it. And in it there is a Garden from the Gardens of Paradise, and a believer who dies in Al-Madinah, will be included in the intercession of the Messenger on a Day when neither wealth nor sons will avail.</p>\r\n<p>And the Prophet (pbuh) declared it inviolable, just as Abraham declared Makkah inviolable. And because it is good, it removes the evil ones from within itself, just as bellows remove the impurities from iron, for verily, Allah defends them, so whoever causes them to fear through injustice, Allah will cause him to fear and Allah\'s curse will be upon him. And it has been called Tabah and likewise, Taibah and so all that is in it is Tayyib (good): its land, its air, its dates, its Mudd and its Sa\' (measures of weight), life therein and death therein. And before all of this, the Mosque of Allah\'s Messenger and his resting place.</p>\r\n<p>And from the starting-point of the high rank, elevated position and lofty standing of Al-Madinah with Allah the Most High, His Messenger (pbuh) and all of the Muslims, we present this book as a work purely and sincerely for Allah and a true expression of our love for the City of the Messenger. And the reader will find in it - Allah willing - abundant facts about the City of the Messenger in spite of its brevity.</p>\r\n<p>And we have taken care to present the most reliable narrations and the most authentic Ahadith. If we are right, it is from Allah and a part of His Grace and Mercy and we think naught of Allah except good.</p>\r\n<p>And may peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet, Muhammad and upon his family and Companions and those who follow them with Ihsan until the Day of Recompense.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>General Manager, Darussalam Publishers</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','This book tells about comprehensive history of Madinah and description of important events & places.',1,'0',0,'28','2013-07-26 06:28:43',2,'2013-07-26 06:28:43',2),(805,'The History of Islam (3 Vol. Set)','The-History-of-Islam-(3-Vol.-S',57,'<p>History stands as the most effective and valuable source of putting nation on the course of progress and prosperity and saving them from the path of disgrace and degradation.</p>\r\n<p>At a time, when there is tough competition among the nations of the world to excel one another, the Muslim, despite having the most glorious history, appear to be detached and careless as regards their history.</p>\r\n<p>This book presents the true Islamic events and their actual causes before the English readers because the other books in the English language found on the Islamic history have been written by such authors and compilers who did no justice in presenting the true picture of Islamic Era but their prejudice prevented them from doing so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3>Publisher&rsquo;s Note</h3>\r\n<p>We are presenting before you the third volume of the book History of Islam. This book was originally written in the Urdu language in 1922 (1343 AH) by Akbar Shah Khan Najeebabadi. This was the time about 25 years before the partition of Indian Subcontinent into Pakistan and India. For the purpose of brevity, the compiler has presented the authentic events in concise form from the famous histories of Islam written in the Arabic and Persian languages by the great Muslim historians like Tabari, Ibn Athir, Mas\'udi, Abul-Fida\', Ibn Khaldun and Suyuti, apart from getting benefited from the authentic books of Ahadith for the compilation of the part about the biography of the Prophet Muhammad. So, this compilation is actually the extract of the works of the famous Muslim historians.</p>\r\n<p>In the first volume, starting with the introduction of the history as a subject, the country, people and conditions of Arabia prior to the advent of Islam were discussed, and an account of the life of Prophet Muhammad was presented including the hardships and opposition he faced while propagating the message of Islam, and the details of migration and the period after it until his death. After that the description of Rightly Guided Caliphate was also discussed in its full perspective.</p>\r\n<p>In this second volume, starting with the Caliphate of Banu Umayyah, the martyrdom of Imam Husain (R) and the Caliphate of the Abbasids, all areas have been covered as far as the expansion of Islam was.</p>\r\n<p>This third volume begins with the description of the conditions of Spain before and after the rule of Muslims and the role played by Umayyad, Abbasid, Almoravid and Almohad Caliphs there and their encounters with the Christian Armies. Then some mention of the conquest of Morocco and North Africa has been given along with the details of Idrisia and Aghlabs rule there. After that detailed accounts of Ganghisid Mongols, Turks and Tartar Mangols have been produced. After that Islamic history of Persia is described giving the accounts of Saffariah, Samanid, Delmid, Gharnavid, Seljuk, Ghourid and Muluk Dynasties with the periods of Khwarizm Shah, Atabeks and Sistan Kings rule there. Then the Islamic history of Egypt and Syria is covered describing the Ubaidullah, Ayyubid and Mamluk Dynasties, and the rule of Atabek and Abbasid Caliphs. In the end, something about the Ottoman Dynasty and its Empire is discussed including the description of the conquest of Constantinople.</p>\r\n<p>We hope that the readers will find this volume also of great help in the study of Islamic history.

This book is not purely historical, for we only relate here the historical events that have had a direct effect on Makkah and its development, sanctity and religious status.</p>\r\n<p>The book begins with a discussion of the sacred nature of Makkah Al-Mukarramah, the boundaries of the Haram (Sanctuary) and its sanctity. Then it discusses the superiority of Makkah and narrates Ahadith to that effect. Then it mentions the names of Makkah and the significance of these names.</p>\r\n<p>This book also speaks of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Isma\'il (Ishmael) (peace be upon them) and their connection to Makkah and its sanctity and development. For Makkah derives its sanctity and high status from the presence of the Ka\'bah in the city. An entire section of the book is devoted to the Ka\'bah and discusses its origins and construction, the connection of Hajrah (Hagar) and Isma\'il (A) to it, what has happened to it as it has been destroyed and rebuilt throughout the ages, and who its custodians have been. The book also discusses the holy places that are connected to it, such as the Maqam (the Station of Ibrahim), Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (the Black Stone), Al-Hijr and Al-Multazam.</p>\r\n<p>Naturally enough, the book devotes a considerable amount of attention to the well of Zamzam, describing the history of its origins, how it was re-dug, its superiority, how its water is used to treat sickness, and real-life examples of that.</p>\r\n<p>Then the book discusses the conquest of Makkah and its far-reaching effects on the history of Makkah and on the future of Islam and its spread, and how the House was cleansed of Shirk (polytheism) and the Mushrikun (polytheists).</p>\r\n<p>There are some important places that always come to mind when Makkah is mentioned, for they are strongly connected to it. It is essential to mention these places also which include: Hira\', the mountain of Thawr, \'Arafat, Al-Muhassir, the mosque of Al-Khaif, Muzdalifah and the graveyard of Al-Mu\'alla.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of the book the reader will find a section devoted to discussion of Hajj and its rituals, because Hajj is strongly connected to Makkah and its sites in the minds of the Muslims.</p>\r\n<p>May Allah bless our Prophet Muhammad and all his family and Companions, and those who follow them in truth until the Day of Judgment.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul-Malik Mujahid,</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>General Manager, Darussalam</em></p>','A concise book about Makkah especially for the guidance of Hajj Pilgrims.

Thus, the more the slave increases in the actualization of At-Tauhid, the more he is likely to enter Paradise, whatever his deeds may be. For this reason the Imaam - may Allah have mercy upon him - mentioned the Verse of Surah AI-An\'am (6:82).</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote1\">[1]</a></strong> And Allah the Most High said,</p>\r\n<p>\"Those who believe and do not mix their belief with Zulm, for them there is security and they are guided ones.\" (6:82)</p>\r\n<p>The word Zulm (wrongdoing, oppression) here means Ash-Shirk. This is like what has been narrated in the Hadith of Ibn Mas\'ud that the Prophet said concerning this Verse when the Companions considered it to be something tremendous (i.e. too difficult). They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Which of us does not wrong himself (i.e. by committing sins)?!\" The Prophet (pbuh) replied,</p>\r\n<p>\"It is not that which you think. The Zulm is As-Shirk. Don\'t you hear the statement of the righteous slave (Lugmaan), \'Verily Ash-Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is a great Zulm (wrongdoing, oppression and injustice) indeed.\"\' (31:13)</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the meaning of the Verse according to what is appropriate for this chapter is: Those who believe and do not mix their faith up with any Shirk; for them there is security and they are guided ones. Thus, the virtue of the one who believes - meaning he singles out Allah with At-Tauhid, and he does not mix his faith up with any Dhulm, meaning he does not mix his belief in At-Tauhid up with any Shirk - is that for him is complete security and guidance. Hence, the more At-Tauhid is decreased by the servant being covered with some types of Dhulm, which is Ash-Shirk, the more the security and guidance leaves him in relative proportion to that.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote2\">[2]</a></strong> He then said: \'Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (r.a) narrated that Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh) said,</p>\r\n<p>\"Whoever testifies that there is none worthy of being worshipped but Allah, Who has no partner, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger...\"</p>\r\n<p>until he said: \"Whatever his deeds may be.\"</p>\r\n<p>This means, even if he was deficient in his deeds and he had sins and acts of disobedience. This is from the bounty of At-Tauhid upon its people.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote3\">[3]</a></strong> He then said: They (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) also recorded the Hadith of \'Itbaan:</p>\r\n<p>\"Indeed Allah has forbidden for Hell the person who says: \'There is nothing worthy of being worshipped but Allah,\' seeking thereby the Face of Allah.\"</p>\r\n<p>When a person says this statement, which is the statement of At-Tauhid, seeking the Face of Allah by it, and he comes with its conditions and its requirements, Allah favors him and gives him what He has promised him of making him forbidden for the Fire. And this is a great bounty and favor. However, whoever comes with At-Tauhid and abstained from that which contradicts it, yet he had some sins and acts of disobedience, and he died without repenting, then he is under the Will of Allah. If Allah wills, He will punish him, then - after some time - He will make the Fire forbidden for him, and if He wills, He will forgive him and make the Fire forbidden for him initially (without punishment).</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote4\">[4]</a></strong> Abu Sa\'eed AI-Khudree narrated that Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh) said,</p>\r\n<p>\"Moosaa (Moses) said: \'O my Lord, teach me something by which I can remember You and supplicate to You.\' Allah answered: \'Say, O Moosaa, La ilaha illallah (non has the wright to be worshipped but Allah)...\"</p>\r\n<p>This means that if it is imagined that the sins of the servant reached the weight of the seven heavens and the weight of all that they contain of slaves and angels, and the weight of the earth, the statement Lailaha illallah would outweigh that weight of sins. This is the great virtue of the statement of At-Tauhid and it is only for whoever the statement becomes strong in his heart. Therefore, he becomes sincere in it and a firm believer in it, having no doubts concerning what it implies. He believes in what it contains and he loves what it implies. Thus, its effect becomes strong in the heart and it enlightens it, and as long as it is like this, it burns (away) whatever it meets of sins.</p>','This is English translation of famous book \"Ghayatul Murid Fi Sharah Kitab-ut-Tawheed\".',1,'0',0,'82','2013-07-29 06:37:51',2,'2013-07-29 06:58:51',2),(829,'Islam is Your Birthright','Islam-is-Your-Birthright',57,'<p>These are the vital questions that arise in the mind of a person when he looks upon the religions for a critical study.

It is also a fact that adherents of each belief call others to follow their leader and extol him. As for Muslim, he does not call people to follow his ideology. His religion is the religion of Allah with which He is pleased. Allah says: \"Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.\"</p>\r\n<p>He also does not call people to glorify a human being, for all human beings are equal in the Religion of Allah; nothing distinguishes one from another except piety. A Muslim rather calls people to follow the path of their Lord, to believe in His Messengers and follow His Law which He revealed to the last of His Messengers Muhammad (pbuh) and which He commanded him to convey to all mankind.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s on this account that I wrote this book in order to call people to the Religion of Allah which He is pleased with and with which He sent His Last Messenger in order to guide those who are looking for guidance and happiness.

Besides being a great scholar, he is also the author and compiler of many books. He holds the honor to have a place in the rank of those authors of present time whose work has been widely accepted.</p>\r\n<p>Because of his simple style, his books gained popularity in the Islamic world. He uses authentic sources while writing the books, that is why his books are appreciated by the scholars. Generally in the Islamic world, and especially in the Arab world, the authenticity of a book is judged by its author\'s name, and his name has acquired such position.</p>','In this book all important and fundamental aspects of Islam are described in an easy form of question/answer.',1,'0',0,'85','2013-07-30 05:05:31',2,'2013-07-30 05:05:31',2),(834,'Islamic Dress Code for Women','Islamic-Dress-Code-for-Women',57,'<h3>Publishers Note</h3>\r\n<p>In our world of chaos and confusion concerning the unending problems of sexual abuses and perversion, most of mankind, who does not&nbsp; have&nbsp;&nbsp; the benefit of Islamic knowledge and guidance, has all but given up&nbsp; hope on how to come to terms with this intractable of all problems.</p>\r\n<p>Men who are embarrassed to face their own weaknesses boldly view the most lewd displays of psychologically damaging visual presentations. Women desperate for fame and fortune allow themselves to be presented as bait for the crudest commercial benefits. That which is naturally abhorrent becomes common place with the exposure and constant bombardment of illicit graphic exhibitions. What is the way out of this dilemma? How can we reclaim our self-respect and the respect of our community?</p>\r\n<p>We have to forego the thrill of uncovering that, which was meant to be covered and we have to forego the thrill of exposing that, which was meant to be hidden. If we don\'t, the disaster that accompanies these crimes will be upon us as a whole. We will pay, our children will pay and our children\'s children will pay. This is certain.</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, as Muslims we have the guidance on how to avoid these problems from the beginning if we follow the laws set out for us by Allah Who knows His creation. Learning the history of those who came before us and who have come to disaster and seeing contemporary non-Muslim societies being devoured and destroyed due to lack of guidance and knowledge should make us rush to the solutions that Allah has provided for us. Prevention is better than cure.</p>\r\n<p>Darussalam presents Islamic Dress Code for Women as a solution to one of the most difficult problems of our time. There is no doubt that woman is an object of beauty. This beauty is a very powerful force; Allah has prescribed how this beauty must be dealt with so that it becomes a force for good and not a source of destruction. Actions are judged by intention in Islam and as such the intention of men concerning the beauty of women must be constantly guarded. The lowering of the eyes by men is a physical act, but without the intention of doing so to protect one\'s piety and obeying Allah, we have stumbled and failed. The struggle to be chaste is the duty of both male and female and we have to cooperate in this struggle by following the very clear guidelines that Allah and His Messenger (pbuh) have set for us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>General Manager, Darussalam</em></p>','This is a complete booklet about important issue of Islamic Jilbab (over-garment), Islamic Hijab (veil) and dress code for women in Islam.',1,'0',0,'13','2013-07-30 05:11:31',2,'2013-07-30 05:22:30',2),(835,'Islamic Educational Series (2 Part Set)','Islamic-Educational-Series-(2-',57,'<p>Our child is the most beloved one for us in the world.</p>\r\n<p>As for his sake we take pains and take care of all his pleasures.

To assist in keeping this lamp lit, it has long been our desire - by the grace of Allah - to translate some of the books written in the Arabic language which are beneficial to every person, bringing common or particular benefits, and translate these useful books into the English language.</p>\r\n<p>Minhaj Al-Muslim, or \"The Way of a Muslim\" is one of these important books whose author is the great scholar Abu Bakr Jabir Al-Jaza\'ri. The author has held the prestige of being a regular lecturer at the Prophet\'s Mosque in Al-Madinah. I had the chance to attend some of his lecturers, his way of teaching is very simple and his lectures find a place in the minds and hearts of the people.</p>\r\n<p>The great author has a very humble and pious personality. If Allah wants someone to have the honor of serving His religion, then He Himself provides him with the necessary requirements. The author was born in \'Liwah\', Al-Jaza\'ir (Algeria) in 1921 CE. He was less than one year old when his father died, his pious mother nurtured the eminent child on the basis of Islamic guidelines. He learned the whole Qur\'an in his youth before he was even twelve years old. He finished his early education in his hometown, then moved to the capital of Al-Jaza\'ir and worked there as a teacher in a school. During that period he attended the lecturers of \'Allamah At-Tayyab Abu Qir and was enlightened with the light of belief in Tawhid and the Sunnah (way) of Prophet (pbuh). When the French colonization began in 1372 AH or 1952 CE, he migrated to Al-Madinah, the city of Prophet (pbuh). King Sa\'ud bin \'Abdul-\'Aziz was the ruler at that time and Al-Madinah University was being established. Abu Bakr Jabir Al-Jaza\'ri first worked as a teacher in Al-Madinah, then he joined Al-Madinah University and worked there until his retirement. He also worked as an adviser and helper in some institutes affiliated with the Muslim World League during that time.</p>\r\n<p>Allah has given the author a great ability in reading and writing so he wrote several books, some small and some larger, totaling about eighty. Besides these he also wrote more than ten large books, among which Minhaj Al-Muslim or \"The Way of a Muslim\", \'Ageedah Mu\'min or \"The Believer\'s Creed\", and a selection on the Sirah (biography) of the Prophet (pbuh) entitled Hadha Al-Habib (This is the Beloved) and his Tafsir of the Qur\'an entitled Aysar AtTafasir are the more popular.</p>\r\n<p>The author wrote this book, Minhaj Al-Muslim, at the request of the people of Wahdah\', a city in Morocco. They desired such a book that included all of the necessary topics like correct belief, etiquette, manners, worship, business and transactions etc. So the author compiled this book after the incessant struggle of about two years, may Allah reward him and increase his benefit to the True Religion.</p>\r\n<p>We have prepared this work in two volumes in the English language due to the large amount of material that the book covers. We hope Allah will reward all of us for the benefit it may provide for the readers.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, should any reader notice some error in our presentation of this text, we ask that they should be so kind as to inform us of that so it may be corrected in future editions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Director, Darussalaam , Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</em></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Author\'s Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Praise is to Allah, Lord of all that exists and the God of those who passed away and those to come. Prayers, peace and blessings be upon the elite of His creation, the last of His Prophets. and Messengers, our master Muhammad, his pure family, and his Companions. May Allah the Almighty show mercy at those who followed them till the Day of Judgement. To proceed:</p>\r\n<p>There was a request made of me from some righteous brothers in the city of Wujdah during my visits to the Islamic lands of Al-Maghrib. These visits were for the purpose of inviting people to adhere to the Book of Allah the Almighty and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah since they are the only way for salvation and the source of strength and welfare for the people. The brothers asked me to compose a book for the righteous believing youth there as well as the Muslims in the general area, to serve as a law or a statute for them. It should comprise all that concerns the righteous Muslim regarding his creed, manners, providing direction for righteous character and acts of worship, and dealings with his colleagues. This book should be based on the light of the Book of Allah the Almighty and the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>I responded to the righteous brothers\' request, seeking help from Allah to compose the requested Minhaj. From the first day of my return to the Holy Land (Makkah and Al-Madinah), I started composing, revising and correcting it. Despite my limited spare time and the great responsibilities I bear, Allah the Almighty has blessed the few hours I managed to steal (save) from my days pocket filled with concerns and preoccupation. Only two years had passed since my start and the book was composed exactly as I hoped and as the brothers requested.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the book that I submit to the righteous of the Muslim brothers in every place. Were I not its author, I would describe it in a way that heightens its value and increases its demand and acceptance to the readers. But it is sufficient for me to say that it is a book which no Muslim house should be without.</p>\r\n<p>As for the topics related to Fiqh, the acts of worship, and other dealings, I spared no effort in investigating and searching for the most sound opinion of the eminent scholars such as Imams Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ash Shafl\'i, and Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on them all, when there was no conclusive text or apparent proof from the Book of Allah the Almighty and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) for a topic.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, I have not the least doubt that he who behaves in accordance with the rulings of this Minhaj either in the subjects of creed, Fiqh, manners, or character, actually behaves in accordance with the Shari\'ah of Allah the Almighty and with the guidance of His Messenger (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>Whenever I chose the opinion of a particular Imam on a matter of Fiqh, I spared no effort in checking the various and numerous sources, and weighing the different opinions of the well known scholars.</p>\r\n<p>Out of my hope that the righteous Muslim brothers should have one way in which their efforts could be unified, their motivation, and their response be united, I was compelled to take such a difficult task under which I bore heavy burdens, and praise is to Allah the Almighty Who enabled and helped me to achieve that goal.</p>\r\n<p>I complain to Allah the Almighty, my Lord, about every person who may say that I have innovated an innovation in this work or I have introduced a tenet contradicting the Muslims.</p>\r\n<p>I pray unto Him against anyone who tries to detract the righteous of this nation from the way or from that Minhaj to which I have invited the people, because I am well aware that I have not deviated, intentionally or unintentionally, even a hair from the Book of Allah the Almighty, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), nor from the sound opinions of the Imams of Islam and the millions of the Muslims who followed them.</p>\r\n<p>I have no objective except that the Muslims be gathered via the shortest route, after their separation and dissipation.</p>\r\n<p>O Allah! The Protector of the believers and the Supporter of the righteous, accept my effort in this Minhaj and make it right and accepted, and reward me for my efforts, and make it beneficial to him who adheres to it and behaved in accordance with it. And O Allah! guide therewith of Your worshippers whom You see deserving of Your guidance, You and only You are the One Able.

The complete set covering the 27,000 hadith will be in 18 volumes once it is printed Insha-Allah. More volumes will be available here once they are available.</p>\r\n<p>One of the greatest compilations of the sunnah and books of hadith is the Musnad by Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal, which is organized into compilations of the hadiths narrated by each Companion (Sahabi), starting with the \'asharah mubashsharah (\"the ten who were promised Paradise\"). This highlights their status and the efforts they made to preserve the ahadeeth of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>The scholars and muhadditheen praised the Musnad of Imam Ahmad. Al-Hafiz Abu Moosa al-Madeeni wrote a book in which he highlighted the great features of the Musnad. In his book he said: \"This book is an important source and trustworthy reference for the scholars of hadeeth, as he (Imam Ahmad) selected from the large number of hadith he came across and the plentiful reports he heard, and he put a great deal of effort into making it a prominent, leading and reliable source. When disputing an issue, it is a refuge and a source of help.\"</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>From the Publisher\'s Note</h3>\r\n<p>One of the noblest and the most important aims of Darussalam is to publish books of ahadeeth (Prophetic narrations). From the very first day of its inception, Darussalam desired to publish translations of books of ahadeeth along with translations of the meanings of the Qur\'an in important languages of the world.</p>\r\n<p>By the grace of Allah, Darussalarn has completed twenty-five years and during these long years, we have published, by the grace of Allah, as many as fourteen hundred books. We started with Riyadhus-Saliheen, which we translated into English and other languages, followed by Bulughul-Maram. Then we published, in quick succession, English translations of the six canonical books of hadeeths (Al-Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and An-Nasa\'i) in 38 volumes - a momentous and pioneering achievement admired by lovers of hadeeths worldwide. This was a unique achievement in Islamic history in that this was the first time the six canonical books of hadeeths were published along with their English translations.</p>\r\n<p>The four Sunan books (Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Majah and An-Nasa\'i) were also documented, referenced, graded and accompanied by footnotes (where necessary).</p>\r\n<p>In the meantime, many a friend of mine asked me to publish the English translation of Musnad Imam Ahmad, the largest collection of ahadith. In fact, I had already pledged to Allah that if I stayed longer in Saudi Arabia, I would surely undertake this work as soon as I got a chance to do it. The Musnad of Imam Ahmad is a reliable and authoritative work containing over twenty seven thousand (27,000) ahadith. The execution of this project was no easy task. In fact, the project exceeded our resources but we relied on Allah and started the work.</p>\r\n<p>The following are the distinctive features of this momentous work:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The words of the Prophet have been highlighted within brackets.</li>\r\n<li>Each hadeeth is accompanied by a commentary determining its degree of authenticity, i.e., detailing whether it is authentic, weak, and so on.</li>\r\n<li>We have specified and referenced which narrations of the Musnad are also found in AI-Bukhari and Muslim.</li>\r\n<li>The verses of the Qur\'an occurring in the texts of hadeeth have been placed within decorative brackets and referenced.</li>\r\n<li>Each hadith is accompanied by words, raji\' (refer) and unzur (see) followed by hadith numbers indicating where that particular hadith has already occurred and where it will occur again.</li>\r\n<li>Another distinctive mark of the Darussalam version setting it apart from other current versions is that we have identified Ziyadat (the additional hadith which Imam Ahmad\'s son, Abdullah, narrated from persons other than his father) and Wijadat (the hadith which Imam Ahmad collected and wrote from other sources), by means of special signs preceding the hadeeth number. Moreover, we have also identified the narrations jointly shared by Imam Ahmad and his teacher or some other narrator.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The English translation of this book of hadith was, no doubt, a difficult and laborious task which was undertaken by Br. Nasir Khattah, a resident of Canada, who has been affiliated to the Darussalam Research Center for the past eighteen years. Translating hadith of the Prophet is a highly sensitive matter and no easy job, and Br. Nasir Khattab, with his extensive experience in this field, having already translated several books of ahadith into English, fulfilled the task to the best of his ability. The editing; was done by Sister Huda Khattab, who completed her part of the job with great diligence and devotion.</p>\r\n<p>At present, in the first stage of the project, we are publishing the first three volumes of Musnad Ahmad. In the following three or four years we hope to complete, Allah willing, the entire project, numbering about 18 volumes in all. We have tried our best to translate the ahadeeth in a simple, easy to understand language because our aim is to reach as large a number of people as possible. Our prayer is that they benefit by it and practice what they learn.</p>\r\n<p>We ask Allah to make this collection of ahadeeth, which is the most comprehensive of its kind, an invaluable asset for the Ummah, a means of their salvation in the Hereafter, and count it among our good deeds on the Day of Judgment.

In fact, the fulfillment of many of our Islamic duties hinges upon our knowledge of the Prophet\'s life. For example, every Muslim should love the Prophet (pbuh) yet how can one love him without knowing him. We were not alive when the Prophet (pbuh) was preaching the message of Islam to the Quraish, so the only way we have left to become intimately acquainted with the Prophet (pbuh) and consequently to love him, is to study his sayings and deeds, which give us partial glimpses of his life, or to study his biography, which fits the pieces of his life together, so that we can have an overall view of his ideal character. And how are we to follow the Prophet (pbuh) if we do not know his sayings and deeds, or - which is more relevant to his biography - the context in which his sayings and deeds occurred. Thus we are all in dire need of acquainting ourselves with the life of the Prophet (pbuh)</p>\r\n<p>Through the study of the Seerah (the Prophet\'s biography), we are able to appreciate how the Prophet (pbuh) was an ideal husband, ideal father, ideal leader, ideal ruler, ideal educator, ideal judge, and so on. So regardless of our situation and who we are, we benefit from studying the Prophet\'s life. If one has dedicated at least some part of his life to inviting others to Islam (which makes him a Daa\'ee - a word I will henceforward use&nbsp; one who invites others to the teachings of Islam), then the Prophet\'s biography is for him an indispensable guidebook. Through studying the Prophet\'s Seerah, the Daa\'ee learns about the Prophet\'s methodology for inviting others to Islam; furthermore, he learns about how the Prophet (pbuh) dealt with those who refused to embrace Islam and how he ;t\",\' was patient when he was made to suffer at their hands, not to mention the countless other lessons and morals he learns from the Seerah.</p>\r\n<p>If one is an educator - of children at home or school, or of adults at a community level - one learns how the best educator mankind has ever known raised a generation of true Muslims, who went on to develop the most wonderful civilization that mankind has ever known. The early converts to Islam were educated in the world\'s finest institution of higher learning - the House of Al-Arqam (the house wherein Muslims secretly met in the early days of Islam) - where the Prophet (pbuh) taught them the Qur\'an, Islamic beliefs, the manners of Islam, and so on. His students graduated with flying colors, becoming leaders and educators of the following generation of Muslims.</p>\r\n<p>If one is a leader, one learns true qualities of leadership from the Prophet\'s Seerah, in terms of how the Prophet (pbuh) was just; how he united the Muslims; how he (pbuh) dealt with subversive elements of society, namely the hypocrites, who were headed by \'Abdullah ibn Ubai ibn Salool; and how he (pbuh) constantly strove for the betterment of the Muslim nation.</p>\r\n<p>If one is a scholar, one relies on the Seerah to understand the Qur\'an, for the Prophet\'s actions represent a practical application of the teachings of the Qur\'an. Furthermore, the revelation of many Verses was prompted by actual events that took place during the Prophet\'s lifetime; a scholar can only understand such Verses if he understands the events for which they were revealed. And in fact (as we will In Sha Allah see throughout this book) knowledge of all Islamic sciences - such as \'Aqeedah (beliefs), jurisprudence, and Tafseer - hinges frequently upon knowledge of some aspect of the Prophet\'s Seerah.</p>\r\n<p>If a Muslim inclines towards Zuhd (to abstain from worldly pleasures for the sake of Allah) he can learn, through the study of the Seerah, the difference between true Zuhd and extremism, for the correct way to live is the balanced life that the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions led. If a Muslim is afflicted by calamity, he can find consolation in the Seerah, for no one was afflicted with as much hardship as was the Messenger of Allah; beyond consolation, the afflicted person becomes encouraged to follow the example of the Prophet; and patiently await for his reward from Allah . In short, there are valuable lessons to be found in the Seerah for every single Muslim.</p>\r\n<p>Not just the Muslim individual, but also the Muslim nation as a whole needs to benefit from the lessons that are available in the Prophet\'s Seerah. Nations rise and fall not through coincidence or through a set of arbitrary occurrences, but through universal laws that have been set in place by Allah . At least once in our history, Muslims have succeeded in building a wonderful and stable civilization, and that was during the lifetime of the Prophetand his rightly guided Caliphs; and even if Muslims prospered in later centuries, they never prospered as much as they did in the early golden years of Islam. Now we come back to the universal laws I mentioned above: The Prophet , and his Companions established a stable and prosperous nation not by chance, but by living in harmony with the said universal laws. What this means is that there is a pattern: If we want to now repeat the success that was achieved by the Muslims during the lifetime of the Prophet Oh, we need to be in harmony with the same set of laws, and in doing so, we have an ideal blueprint to follow - the lives of the Prophet (pbuh) and his noble Companions (r.a).</p>','A complete record of the events of the Prophet\'s life, from his noble birth and even before that day for background information until the day he (pbuh) died.',1,'0',0,'105','2013-08-11 16:49:22',2,'2013-08-11 16:49:22',2),(905,'Now You are a Mother','Now-You-are-a-Mother',57,'<p>This book has given an overview of the mother\'s role and touched on the basics of raising babies and small children.

Its primary goal is to help such learners develop the ability to communicate in English according to the situation, purpose and roles of the participants. The learner is presented throughout the course with natural and useful language, and is taught how to use English for everyday life situations and purposes related to many aspects of life including work, social life and leisure.</p>\r\n<p>Each unit begins with the vocabulary words and expressions intended to be used in the unit out of context; some other units begin with the grammatical points to be covered in them. Grammar points are carefully graded in the course. There is no explanation of grammatical points, as this places a great burden on the learner\'s shoulders and tends to put him off learning the language altogether. Therefore, grammatical points have been presented communicatively through the use of a variety of short conversations that will help give the learner an idea of how they can be accurately used.</p>\r\n<p>The course consists of five books. The first four books comprise twenty units each, each of which has two review units to consolidate language learnt in the previous units. The fifth book is a collection of true short stories and a few hilarious jokes in straightforward English to entertain the learner and familiarize him with written English.</p>\r\n<p>It is strongly recommended to use these books in conjunction with the Language Master device for maximum benefit. This device, which combines learning and fun, has a number of features that will certainly help the learner derive great benefit from the course. By using this device, the learner will be able to listen to any text in these books, repeat after the recorded text, record his own voice, compare his own voice with the original voice, and choose the speed level he desires for maximum understanding and learning. All these activities can be simply carried out at the touch of a button!</p>\r\n<p>The present project owes its existence, first and foremost, to Almighty Allah, without whose assistance it would not have been possible to see the light of day. The idea behind the entire project was that of Brother Abdul Malik Mujahid, general manager of Darussalam International Publishers and Distributors, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who made invaluable comments while the five books were in preparation.

To understand Islam, one should emphasize upon the basic belief and its principles. In this book, out of five pillars of Islam, Shahadah and Salat have been dealt with to present the true significance of Islam and the effects of firm belief in all the aspects of human life.</p>\r\n<p>Shahadah is the witness of believing in one and the true Creator - the Islamic Monotheism. This belief is the centre point of Islamic Faith. Accepting this belief means the negating of polytheism - the setting up of partners with Allah in all His Attributes. The belief in Islamic Monotheism creates a tremendous effect in a human being regarding all of his actions and motives.</p>\r\n<p>Salat is the worship enjoined upon a believer, and it is a means of showing his obedience in words and deeds to his Lord and thus achieving His nearness. Through Salat a man acquires spiritual strength to words peace and happiness.

Salah is the Pillar of Islam, on which the religion is firmly established. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: \"The head of the matter (religion) is Islam, its pillar is the prayer and its highest peak is Jihad for Allah\'s cause\" Tirmidhi, Hadith 2616.</p>\r\n<p>Salah constitutes the physical, mental and spiritual submission to Allah which starts by pronouncing \"Allah is Great\" and ends with the Salam (salutation of peace). It is the concrete proof of our submission to Allah. It fulfils our very purpose of creation. Allah makes it very clear in the Glorious Qur\'an that the very purpose for which He has created us is to worship Him throughout our lives. He tells us: \"And I have created not the jinn and men except that they should worship Me (Alone). I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me.\" Adh-Dhariyat Surah 51, V.56-57</p>\r\n<p>\"So glorify the praises of your Rabb (Lord) and be of those who prostrate themselves (to Him). And worship your Rabb (Lord) until there comes unto you the Hour that is certain.\" Al-Hijr Surah 15, V98-99</p>\r\n<p>Salah is an obligation to be fulfilled throughout one\'s life and must be established even in times of fear. Allah said: \"Guard strictly (the five obligatory) Salawaat, especially the middle Salah (\'Asr). And stand before Allah with submission and do not speak to others during the Salah. And if you fear (an enemy), perform Salah on foot or riding. And when you are safe, perform Salah in the manner He has taught you, which you knew not (before).\" Al-Baqarah Surah 2, V.238-239</p>\r\n<p>The Prophet said: \"Order your children to be punctual in Salah when they attain the age of seven years and when they attain the age of ten years hit them for abandoning Salah and provide them with separate beds.\" Abu Dauwd, Hadith 495</p>','A Complete & comprehensive book explaining every aspect related to prayer (Salat, Salah) according to the Quran and Sahih Hadith (Hadeeth).',1,'0',0,'60','2013-08-12 11:50:54',2,'2013-08-12 11:50:54',2),(912,'The Prayer & Purification','The-Prayer-&-Purification',57,'<p>In this treatise the correct procedures of prayer (Salaah) are clarified for the new Muslim.

He comes in many disguises, and spares no effort to turn Muslims away from their religion and its sublime principles and teachings. Disbeliever people are threatened by the Muslim\'s superior lifestyle that is spotless and beyond reproach. They are well aware that as long as Muslims adhere to their religion, all attempts to corrupt them will be futile, because Islam is the source of their power. Islam is that which raises a mere individual into something higher and more dignified. And, for this reason, Islam is severely attacked through all forms of non-Muslim media. It is a cheap attempt to corrupt young minds away from something great to something pitiful: the life outside of Islam. Through following Islamic guidance, we glorify our Creator, Allah, and we become the best example of human beings.</p>\r\n<p>The enemy (Shaytan) tries to convince us that the material world is the way to all success and power. This attack tries to convince Muslims that their weakness stems from their adherence to their religion, its creeds and principles. The media, or so called entertainment, is the vehicle which smears all young minds, so Muslim families should be especially careful of what this entertainment has the proven power to do: corrupt our youth\'s pristine values, slowly, without notice. Instead of taking on the Prophet Muhammad\'s personality that is without any blemish, unknowing youth sadly mimic fictitious personalities in the movies or on the television, and this is how Shaytan wins.</p>\r\n<p>Strong Muslims are capable of making a choice of personality to mimic and remain steadfast on it, while the weak and ignorant are prone to get mislead. So, more than ever, it is incumbent upon us to talk to our youth, and even we adults should reflect on the greatness of our great Muslim heroes from our Islamic past, who built the most glorious and powerful civilization of all. Who took a crass society of measly people and gave them Islam that dramatically improved their lives. These were civilizations that encompassed both sublime Muslim morals, and great material progress simultaneously.</p>\r\n<p>We want to present this book \'The Precious Pearls - the Description of the Ten Companions Who were Given the Glad Tidings of Paradise\' to our youth as a legacy hoping that they will continue on toward finding the higher and real values that Islam suggests to acquire. In it are the models to follow instead of mimicking inferior, fictitious and corrupt personalities presented to us by non-Muslims.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>General Manager, Darussalam</em></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Preface</h3>\r\n<p>The human soul strives to achieve happiness in all its endeavors. Strangely, many people during this pursuit find nothing but disaster and failure. This happens when one is outside of Islamic guidance, and especially happens to individuals who are only following after that proverbial rainbow where they think a barrel of treasure is the answer to their miseries. A great philosopher, named Aristotle, said that happiness is achieved through contemplation of the Divine (Allah) and by leading a disciplined life. What describes Islam better than saying that it is a \'disciplined way of life?\'</p>\r\n<p>The Companions of Allah\'s Messenger were perfectly cognizant of this fact. Thus, they sought to please Allah; and in doing so, they achieved not only happiness but material prosperity as well. The Islamic community is one where wealth is shared. Those who have most, share the most; and those in need are looked after. In pleasing Allah, our scales of good deeds pile up and Paradise is our final reward. What better reward and place to work toward than Paradise?</p>\r\n<p>Jihad can be an everyday event. The Companions were horsemen by day and spent their evenings in worship. They were people of prayer, fasting, charity, kindness and truthfulness. They were chaste, sincere and pious. They were people who knew self-control of mind, body and temper. They did not go about feeding their lusts. They went about instead feeding the hungry. All of these things are Jihad.</p>\r\n<p>When the call for Jihad (meaning war or struggle) was proclaimed, the Companions readily sacrificed everything: their wealth, their lives, and they left their families behind. The fear of death was not an issue, for they knew no better reason or way to die than in fighting to uphold Muslim\'s rights or Islamic values. And this is the true meaning of the testimony: La ilaha illallah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). In return for their loyalty to the cause, Allah bestowed on them true happiness and Paradise.</p>\r\n<p>Paradise is the final abode of all pious and sincere believers. There were many Companions who were given the glad tidings of Paradise out of acknowledgment of their virtues and high status. As we follow this book, we will learn about them. And, in doing so, we will learn the way to Paradise.</p>','The description of the ten companions who were given the Glad Tidings of Paradise.',1,'0',0,'2','2013-08-13 06:09:17',2,'2013-08-13 06:09:17',2),(915,'The Principles of Leadership','The-Principles-of-Leadership',57,'<p>Dr. Yusuf bin Uthman Al Huzaim offers an insightful awareness of the many theories and practices of leadership deriving from Islamic heritage and the modern American experience.

In this quest for Truth, spanning many centuries and diverse civilizations, organized religion has shaped human life and determined to a large extent, the course of history. While some religions have been based on books, claimed by their adherents to be divinely inspired, others have relied solely on human experience.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Al-Qur\'an, the main source of the Islamic faith, is a book believed by Muslims, to be of completely Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it contains Divine guidance for all humankind. Since the message of the Qur\'an is believed to be for all times, it should be relevant to every age. Does the Qur\'an pass this test? In this booklet, I intend to give an objective analysis of the Muslim belief regarding the Divine origin of the Qur\'an, in the light of established scientific discoveries.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>There was a time, in the history of world civilization, when \'miracles\', or what was perceived to be a miracle, took precedence over human reason and logic. But how do we define the term \'miracle\'? A miracle is anything that takes place out of the normal course of life and for which humankind has no explanation. However, we must be careful before we accept something as a miracle. An article in `The Times of India\', Mumbai, in 1993 reported that \'a saint\' by the name \'Baba Pilot\' claimed to have stayed continuously submerged under water in a tank for three consecutive days and nights.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>However, when reporters wanted to examine the base of the tank of water where he claimed to have performed this \'miraculous\' feat, he refused to let them do so. He argued by asking as to how one could examine the womb of a mother that gives birth to a child. The `Baba\' was hiding something. It as a gimmick simply to gain publicity.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Surely, no modern man with even the slightest inkling towards rational thinking would accept such a \'miracle\'. If such false miracles are the tests of divinity, then we would have to accept Mr. P.C. Sorcar, the world famous magician known for his ingenious magical tricks and illusions, as the best god-man.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>A book, claiming Divine origin, is in effect, claiming to be a miracle. Such a claim should be easily verifiable in any age, according to the standards of that age. Muslims believe, that the Qur\'an is the last and final revelation of God, the miracle of miracles revealed as a mercy to humankind. Let us therefore investigate the veracity of this belief.</span></p>','Dr. Zakir Naik describes some of many Scientific Miracles of the Quran.',1,'0',0,'47','2013-08-15 07:15:32',2,'2013-08-15 07:15:32',2),(924,'The Quran - The Divine Revelation','The-Quran---The-Divine-Revelat',57,'<p>\'The Qur\'an: The Divine Revelation\' is the 2nd brief valuable booklet from Dr. Norlain Dindong Mababaya which Darussalam has published.

The framework for this advice is provided by the advice of the Prophet (pbuh) to Mu\'aadh ibn Jabal (r.a): \"O Mu\'aadh, fear Allah wherever you are, and follow up a bad deed with a good one and it will wipe it out, and behave well towards people.\" (Tirimidhi)</p>\r\n<p>The advice contained in this book covers what would make one attain the good of this world and the hereafter insha Allah. Other than being a discourse of how a servant can remain attached to his Lord, the advice contained in this book also focuses on interpersonal relationship between human beings (i.e. being good to others by giving them their rights, being just to them etc).</p>\r\n<p><em>Book #1 - ISBN: 9960-9963-5-6 / 9960996356 - Pages: 82</em></p>\r\n<h3>Book 2 - O My Son! (The Advice of Luqmaan)</h3>\r\n<p>One of the duties parents owe their children is to guide them aright by educating them. They are obligated to correct their children\'s errors and most importantly guide them to live a life that is pleasing to Allah by teaching them the means of achieving that.</p>\r\n<p>To assist the parents in discharging these responsibilities, Allah &nbsp;gave clear guidance in the Quran. He gave us the example of a dutiful father-Luqman and the advice he gave to his son: \"And (remember) when Luqman said to his son when he was advising him: \'0 my son! Join not in worship others with Allah. Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great Zulm (injustice) indeed.\" (Luqman 311: 13)</p>\r\n<p>Our success as parents is determined largely by how well we are able to discharge those responsibilities Allah O has placed on us regarding our children. This book explains different aspects of the advice of Luqmaan to his son and its significance for a successful life.</p>\r\n<p><em>Book #2 - ISBN: 9960-9963-2-5 / 9960996325 - Pages: 112</em></p>\r\n<h3>Book 3 - Do not Become Angry</h3>\r\n<p>Much of the flaws that afflict the individual and the community stem from the singular defect of Anger. Allah &nbsp;and His Messenger (pbuh) have given us instructions regarding the malady and advised us to keep it in check. This work is an extensive discussion on these instructions. We hope that this concise work will aid the one who is afflicted with this flaw to find cure in, insha Allah; while the one who is free of it will find enough incentives to keep his emotions under control.</p>\r\n<p><em>Book #3 - ISBN: 9960-9963-3-2 / 9960996332 - Pages: 75</em></p>\r\n<h3>Book 4 - Guard the Tongue</h3>\r\n<p>How many people have earned the wrath of Allah as a result of misuse of their tongues? How many injuries that may never heal have been inflicted through the careless slips of the tongue? The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: \"Indeed, the servant will speak words that are pleasing to Allah, due to which he will be given a condition in which Allah will raise him many levels. And indeed, the servant will speak words that are displeasing to Allah, due to which he will not be given a good condition, but (instead) be thrown into the Hellfire.\" (Bukhari)</p>\r\n<p>This book highlights those sins that seem so light on the tongue yet so grave on the scale and offers practical advice on how to keep the tongue in check.</p>\r\n<p><em>Book 4 - ISBN: 9960-9963-9-4 / 9960996394 - Pages: 131</em></p>\r\n<h3>Book 5 - Be patient and Paradise will be Yours</h3>\r\n<p>After Eman (faith), the most honorable trait with which man could be endowed is patience. It is the best course of action in all situations. It is a cause for Allah\'s mercy and help. It is a source of spiritual joy. The final victory in both matters of the world and Hereafter is only earned by patience and the good end beings only to the patient ones. Our trials in this world are numerous and varied. Sometime, they come as difficulties and some other times in forms of ease. Situations that life turns on us sometimes could stretch our will and faith to the extreme. In all situations, patience and eemaan remain our most valued companions for the Prophet (pbuh) said: \"Whoever remains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater than patience.\" (Bukhaaree)</p>\r\n<p>This book is a discussion of patience and how to develop that trait so that we might be a recipient of one of Allah\'s greatest blessings.</p>\r\n<p><em>Book #5 - ISBN: 9960-9969-1-2 / 9960996912 - Pages: 88</em></p>\r\n<h3>Book 6 - Rizq and Lawful Earning</h3>\r\n<p>Narrated by Umar ibn al-Khattaab (r.a), the Prophet (pbuh) said: \"If you put your faith completely in Allah, He will arrange for your sustenance in the same way as he provides for the bird. They go out in the morning with their stomachs empty and return filled in the evening.\" (Tirmidhee)</p>\r\n<p>This book discusses the place of pride Islaam gives to making lawful earnings and rizq through hard work and striving. It also looks at the contempt Islaam places on begging and indolence. Then it looks at which earnings are lawful, which are not and the many ways by which wealth can increase while seeking the pleasure of Allah.</p>\r\n<p><em>Book #6 - ISBN: 9960-9969-2-9 / 9960996929 - Pages: 103</em></p>\r\n<h3>Book 7 - Do not be Envious</h3>\r\n<p>Ever heard of the cause of the first disobedience in the heavens? ENVY! That was it! Ibless (Shaytaan) disobeyed Allah, his Lord, out of envy, arrogance and pride. (See Al-Araaf [7]: 12). Envy is also one of the commonest sins on earth! It is the deadly disease of the heart that destroys personal as well as communal relationships!</p>\r\n<p>ENVY: its causes, its effects and how to deal with it, is the subject of this small but beneficial book. May the one Who is afflicted with this disease fine cure in the prescription contained in this book.

The society is made up of homes and it is the origin. The home is life and the life is society. If the home is strong and morally sound, it will reflect in the larger society. Whatever the home is made up of that is the reflection that will be seen in the society. When the society is morally bankrupt it should be traced to the home. To rescue our society from destruction the home needs to be rebuilt on sound footings. The Messenger of Allah (pbuh) said: \"Happiness has four elements; a good wife, a spacious house, a good neighbor and a good riding beast.\" (Ibn Hibbaan) From this hadeeth, it can be seen that three out of the four elements of happiness concern the home.</p>\r\n<p>This book highlights the means and processes of building a Muslim home which guarantees sakeenah (tranquility).

How do we teach them? The Messenger of Allah &nbsp;showed the way of Tarbiyah for Muslims in his life-forming advice to Abdullah ibn Abbas? This book is an insight into the basic Islamic teaching that children should be taught significant things early in life, so that they may live a meaningful life. It is must for every home.</p>\r\n<p>Is it not time to call our children and advise them with the words of the Prophet (pbuh)?</p>\r\n<p>\"O young man, I shall teach you some wards (of advice): Be mindful of Allah, and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you.

He said: `Affirm, `My Lord is Allah\' and then be steadfast.\' Then I said: `Messenger of Allah, what is that you are most afraid of in my case?\' He took hold of his tongue and said: `Of this.\'\" (Tirmidhee)</p>\r\n<p>This book, insha Allah, gives a concise insight into what it means to be steadfast, the kind of sections that necessitate being steadfast and the various ways and means of keeping steadfast in our faith.</p>\r\n<p><em>Book #10 - ISBN: 9960-9967-1-4 / 9960996714 - Pages: 112</em></p>','Ten beautiful books teaching Muslim the etiquette, ethics and basic regulations to make individual life, home life and social life a Paradise.',1,'0',0,'2','2013-08-18 12:38:45',2,'2013-08-18 12:44:36',2),(930,'Prophets Sent by Allah Series (15 Books Set)','Prophets-Sent-by-Allah-Series-',57,'<p><span>The \"Prophets sent by Allah\" series is a collection of 15 delightful rhyming storybooks for younger readers.

Hence, we thought English speaking Muslims would benefit from this translated response by Shaikh Abdul-Aziz bin Abdullah bin Baz, one of the noted scholars of our time and a staunch supporter and defender of the Manhaj of the Righteous Predecessors (As-Salaf As-Saalih). Shaikh Ibn Baz\'s response is a refutation of the misguided effort of Dr. Ibraahim An-Naasir to allow Ribaa transactions.</p>\r\n<p>The Manhaj (way, method) of As-Salaf As-Saalih (meaning the Companions and the following two generations of Islam) has been blessed in our time by the presence of several noted scholars of Hadeeth and Islamic Jurisprudence (Filth). These scholars combine both vast knowledge in the religion and firm adherence to the Qur\'an and the Sunnah according to the way the Salaf understood and implemented them. Shaikh Ibn Baz is one of these scholars and firmly advocates the Manhaj of the Salaf through his lectures, writings and rebuttals of misguided ideas and deviant opinions, such as this research. We ask Allah to reward our scholars and to raise high the flag of the Salaf and their Manhaj.</p>\r\n<p>This short response by Shaikh Ibn Baz that asserts the strict prohibition of all types of Ribaa transactions comes at a time when several so-called scholars are issuing Fatwas (religious decrees) allowing some and even most types of Ribaa. These false, deviant and erroneous Fatwas are especially welcomed by some Muslim communities and individuals who live in non-Muslim countries and who often end up imitating the ways of the Kuffaar (disbelievers) in the societies in which they live. Such people quickly embrace the misguided Fatwas that allow Ribaa, because they think that these Fatwas legalize and justify their indulging in the various types and forms of Ribaa that exist in the present time. I ask Allah to benefit these Muslims and the rest of the Muslim Ummah (nation) with this rebuttal so that they all refrain from indulging in Ribaa, in particular, and in all that Allah has forbidden for them, in general. I also ask Allah to bless the efforts of our scholars who surely face tremendous challenges in recent times, often defending the religion of Allah and His stated limits on several fronts at the same time. They defend the religion against various kinds of attacks by the enemies of Islam and the innovators in the religion. In particular, I ask Allah to grant His best rewards to Shaikh Abdul Aziz bin Baz, who wrote this rebuttal, Shaikh Muhammad Nasir ud-Din AlAlbani, Shaikh Muhammad bin Salih AlUthaimin and the rest of the scholars in general who follow the Qur\'an, the Sunnah and the understanding of the Salaf As-Saalih. Aameen.</p>\r\n<h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>All praise is due to Allah, Whom we thank and seek for help and forgiveness. We seek refuge with Allah from the evils of ourselves and from the wrongdoing of our actions. Whomever Allah guides, there is none who can mislead him, and whomever He leaves astray, there is none who can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>\r\n<p>\"O you who believe! Fear Allah as He deserves to be feared, and die not except as Muslims.\" (3:102)</p>\r\n<p>\"O mankind! Fear your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife (Eve), and from them both He created many men and women, and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights), and (do not cut the relations) of the wombs (kinship) ! Surely, Allah is Ever an All-Watcher over you.\" (4:1)</p>\r\n<p>\"O you who believe! Fear Allah, and say a correct word that is correct (i.e. the truth). He will direct you to do righteous deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great achievement.\" (33:70-71)</p>\r\n<p>To proceed: Verily, the best speech is the Book of Allah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad. The worst matters are newly invented matters (in the religion), and every newly invented matter is an innovation (Bid\'ah), every innovation is a misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hell-fire.</p>\r\n<h3>Table of Contents</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Publisher\'s Note</li>\r\n<li>Introduction</li>\r\n<li>My work on this book</li>\r\n<li>Shaikh Ibn Baz said</li>\r\n<li>The rebuttal</li>\r\n<li>Allah will bless the Muslim economy as long as the Muslims govern by His Law</li>\r\n<li>Economic preeminence does not require Ribaa</li>\r\n<li>Financial institutions can and do survive without Ribaa</li>\r\n<li>They call Ribaa as \'Al-Faa\'idah\', \'Interest\', etc.</li>\r\n<li>Ribaa is forbidden because Allah has forbidden it</li>\r\n<li>What Allah has forbidden does not benefit mankind</li>\r\n<li>Ribaa is a prohibited type of transaction</li>\r\n<li>Qiiyaas is only, allowed where there are no texts in the Qur\'an or Sunnah</li>\r\n<li>Ribaa is forbidden any way you look at it</li>\r\n<li>Allah has allowed the transaction called As-Salam</li>\r\n<li>The Muslim economy does not need Ribaa transactions</li>\r\n<li>The Muslim economy needs to implement Allah\'s Law to survive and flourish</li>\r\n<li>Comparing the Haraam to the Halaal to justify the Haraam is forbidden</li>\r\n</ol>','An Important Warning against Ribaa, Usuary & Interest Transactions',1,'0',0,'23','2013-09-10 05:46:01',2,'2013-09-14 05:14:08',2),(945,'Should a Muslim follow a Particular Madhhab?','Should-a-Muslim-follow-a-Parti',57,'<h3>Should a Muslim follow a Particular Madhhab?</h3>\r\n<p>In this book, the author has widely described the main principle of Taqleed.

Peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and on his family and companions.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>We have undoubtedly sent down the Reminder, and We will truly preserve it. (Al-Qur\'an, Surah al-Hijr, 15:9)</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>The above promise made by Allah is obviously fulfilled in the undisputed purity of the Qur\'anic text throughout the fourteen centuries since its revelation. However, what is often forgotten by many Muslims is that the above divine promise also includes, by necessity, the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) for it is the practical example of the implementation of the Qur\'anic guidance, the Wisdom taught to the Prophet (pbuh) along with Scripture, and neither the Qur\'an nor the Sunnah can be understood correctly without recourse to the other.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Hence, Allah preserved the Qur\'an from being initially lost by the martyrdom of its memorizers, by guiding the Rightly-Guided Caliphs, endorsed by the consensus of the Messenger\'s Companions (R) to compile the ayat (signs, miracles, \"Verses\") of the Qur\'an into one volume, after these had been scattered in writing on various materials and in memory amongst many faithful hearts. He safeguarded it from corruption by its enemies: disbelievers, heretics, and false prophets, by enabling millions of believers to commit it to memory with ease. He protected its teachings by causing thousands of people of knowledge to learn from its deep treasures and convey them to the masses, and by sending revivers of His Deen at the beginning of every century.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Similarly, Allah preserved the Sunnah by enabling the Companions and those after them (R) to memorize, write down and pass on the statements of the Messenger (pbuh) and the descriptions of his Way, as well as to continue the blessings of practicing the Sunnah. Later, as the purity of the knowledge of the Sunnah became threatened, Allah caused the Muslim nation to produce outstanding individuals of incredible memory-skills and analytical expertise, who journeyed tirelessly to collect hundreds of thousands of narrations and distinguish the true words of precious wisdom of their Messenger (pbuh), from those corrupted by weak memories, from forgeries by unscrupulous liars, and from the statements of the enormous number of \'ulama\', the Companions and those who followed their way, who had taught in various centers of learning and helped to transmit the legacy of Muhammad (pbuh) - all of this achieved through precise attention to the words narrated and detailed familiarity with the biographies of the thousands of reporters of Hadith. Action being the best way to preserve teachings, the revivers of Islam also revived the practice of the blessed authentic Sunnah. (continued on page 8)</span></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>SECTION A: INTRODUCTION</span></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>The Muslims are agreed that the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) is the second of the two revealed fundamental sources of Islam, after the Glorious Qur\'an. The authentic Sunnah is contained within the vast body of Hadith literature.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>A hadith (pl. ahadith) is composed of two parts: the matn (text) and the isnad (chain of reporters). A text may seem to be logical and reasonable but it needs an authentic isnad with reliable reporters to be acceptable; \'Abdullah bin Al-Mubarak (d. 181 AH), one of the illustrious teachers of Imam al-Bukhari, said:</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>&ldquo;The isnad is part of the religion: had it not been for the isnad, whoever wished to would have said whatever he liked.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>During the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) and after his death, his Companions (Sahabah) used to refer to him directly, when quoting his saying. The Successors (Tabi\'un) followed suit; some of them used to quote the Prophet (pbuh) through the Companions while others would omit the intermediate authority - such a hadith was .later known as mursal. It was found that the missing link between the Successor and the Prophet (pbuh) might be one person, i.e. a Companion, or two people, the extra person being an older Successor who heard the hadith from the Companion. This is an example of how the need for the verification of each isnad arose. Imam Malik (d. 179) said, \"The first one to utilize the isnad was Ibn Shihab al Zuhri\" (d. 124). The other more important reason was the deliberate fabrication of ahadith by various sects which appeared amongst the Muslims, in order to support their views (see later, under discussion of maudu\' ahadith). Ibn Sirin (d. 110), a Successor, said, \"They would not ask about the isnad: But when the fitnah (trouble, turmoil, esp. civil war) happened, they said: Name to us your men. So the narrations of the Ahl al&not;Sunnah (Adherents to the Sunnah) would be accepted, while those of the Ahl al-Bid \'ah (Adherents to Innovation) would not be accepted. \"</span></p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>A brief history of Mustalah al-Hadith</span></h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>As time passed, more reports were involved in each isnad, and so the situation demanded strict discipline in the acceptance of ahadith; the rules regulating this discipline are known as Mustalah al-Hadith (the Classification of Hadith).</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Amongst the early traditionists (muhaddithin, scholars of Hadith), the rules and criteria governing their study of Hadith were meticulous but some of their terminology varied from person to person, and their principles began to be systematically written down, but scattered amongst various books, e.g. in Al&not;-Risalah of al-Shafi\'l (d. 204), the Introduction to the Sahih of Muslim (d. 261) and the Jami \' of al-Tirmidhi (d. 279); many of the criteria of early traditionists, e.g. al-Bukhari, were deduced by later scholars from a careful study of which reporters or isnads were accepted and rejected by them.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>One of the earliest writings to attempt to cover Mustalah comprehensively, using standard (i.e. generally-accepted) terminology, was the work by al-Ramahurmuzi (d. 360). The next major contribution was Ma\'rifah \'Ulum al-Hadith by al &not;Hakim (d. 405), which covered fifty classifications of Hadith, but still left some points untouched; Abu Nu\'aim al-Isbahani (d. 430) completed some of the missing parts to this work. After that came Al-Kifayah fi \'lim al-Riwayah of al-Khatib al-Baghdadi (d. 463) and another work on the manner of teaching and studying Hadith; later scholars were considered to be greatly indebted to al-Khatib\'s work.

However, areas that are not covered enough for the English reader are the historical development of science and technology in the Muslim world, and the factors that led to its rise and decline. The decline has been so severe, that today\'s Muslims are not even aware that their ancestors were the founding fathers of modern sciences.

It is a summarization that makes memorization easy for those who wish to memorize it. It also makes things easier for the one who wants to investigate or look into the Sahih.

There are many collections and compilations of Ahadith . Among these the most famous are the six collections which are known as Kutub Sittah, these are Sahih Al-Bukhari, Sahih Muslim, Sunan Abu Dawud, Sunan An-Nasa\'i, Al-Jami` litTirmidhi and Sunan Ibn Majah. The first two are regarded more authentic and known as Sahihain. Out of these two, Sahih AI-Bukhari has a higher position and is termed as the most reliable book after the Noble Qur\'an.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have presented the translations of Sahih AI-Bukhari in the English language in nine volumes, and also its summarized edition in one volume. Now, we are presenting the English translation of Summarized Sahih Muslim in two volumes. Although Sahih Al-Bukhari is the most reliable collection of Ahadith, however, Sahih Muslim has certain aspects of superiority. Imam Muslim adhered strictly to most of the principles of the Science of Hadith which were somehow at some places ignored by his teacher Imam Bukhari. Imam Muslim accepted for his collection only such Ahadith which had been transmitted with an unbroken chain of reliable narrators, free from all defects and were in perfect harmony with the narrations of other narrators. He has recorded only those Ahadith which were transmitted at least by two different narrators from two different Companions. Imam Bukhari has sometimes used the Kunyah (surname) of the narrators and sometimes their names. Imam Muslim avoided this confusion. Imam Muslim is also particular in pointing out the slightest difference in the text of the narrations. Imam Bukhari has fragmented most of the Ahadith and presented the portions under different chapters, while Imam Muslim presented them as a whole narration. So, the works of both Imams provide different approaches for the scholars and readers of Ahadith.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As about 58% Ahadith of Sahih Muslim are also found in Sahih Al-Bukhari, we have based the translation of such Ahadith on the translation of Sahih Al-Bukhari by Dr. Muhsin Khan. We are also benefited from the translation of Sahih Muslim by Abdul Hamid Siddiqi which was published in Pakistan. It took about five years to complete the project, and various translators and editors of Darussalam worked on it. Finally, Mr. Sidheeque M. A. Veliankode and Mr. Mohammad Ayub worked on it and gave the present shape to it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We hope that this presentation will be appreciated by the readers and we ask Allah to give us strength and means to work on other projects in the cause of Islam -Amin!</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><em>General Manager, Darussalam Publishers</em></p>','Summarized Sahih Muslim contains collection of 2179 Hadith with 70 categories from Sahih Muslim.',1,'0',0,'129','2013-09-13 11:56:08',218,'2013-09-16 07:43:19',2),(954,'Short Biography of the Prophet and his Ten Companions','Short-Biography-of-The-Prophet',57,'<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>The renowned Muslim scholar Al-Hafiz Abdul-Ghani Al-Maqdisi has compiled this book bearing the abridged biographies of the Prophet and his Ten Companions who were given the glad tidings of Paradise.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>It is our duty to know about the lives of the Prophet and his Companions in order to learn the teachings of Islam.

And the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him.\"\' [Al-Bukhari]</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Commentary: 1. Those who make innovations in religion and associate partners with Allah (such as Haluli -who believe in the indwelling light in the soul of man, Wajudi - who believe in the physical form of Allah, and pagans who worship other than Allah) interpret this Hadith in support of their base contention and thus seek support of one wrong from another although the meaning and interpretation of the Hadith is not at all what the describe. In simple and unambiguous terms, the Hadith means that when a person adds voluntary prayers to the obligatory ones, he becomes a favorite slave of Allah and on account of it, he receives special help from Allah. Then he is protected by Allah to the extent that He supervises every organ of his body. Thus. he is saved from disobedience of Allah. He bears what is Hiked by Allah, sees what is liked by Him, handles what pleases Him. When he attains that lofty position of love and obedience of Allah then Allah in return also grants prayers of His obedient and loyal slaves.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>2. A saint is not one who has a peculiar get up and appearance, or who occupies the seat of a saint as his successor, or a person who is lost in meditation, or a half-mad, or one who has invented his own style of remembrance and worship of Allah, but it is one who strictly fulfils the obligations imposed by Islam, is fond of voluntary prayers and adheres to Divine injunctions in every walk of life.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>3. The love of such saints is a means to attain the Pleasure of Allah, and enmity (hatred and repulsion) with them is a cause of His serious displeasure and wrath.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>4. Voluntary prayer is certainly a means of attaining the Pleasure of Allah, but it must be preceded by the fulfillment of obligatory prayers. The former is of no value if the latter is neglected. The desire to attain nearness of Allah without strict observance of the obligatory prayers is fallacious and meaningless</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span><br /></span></p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hadith 96.

Vols.)','Sahih-Muslim-(7-Vols.)',57,'<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sahih Muslim is the most authentic book of Hadith after Sahih Al-Bukhari and contains 7,563 Ahadith. The Muslim Scholars have agreed that all of the Ahadith in Sahih Muslim are authentic. Thus, Darussalam realized the great benefit of publishing the full version of Sahih Muslim in the English language in the best presentation. Much care has been taken in rendering these Ahadith into a clear and simple style of modern English.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This fine-quality edition of Sahih Muslim has been verified by Dar-us-Salam Publications extensively. Its translation has been checked several times as not only to avoid mistranslating but also to avoid misinterpreting the ahadith as done by many translators of the current times in order to rush the product to market or to their lack of understanding of the Arabic language. Unlike other publishers which leave you wondering about the meaning of the ahadith, the unclear wording has been explained in the brackets. There are also footnotes on bottom of some of the pages, when the term cannot be explained in the brackets. This edition of Dar-us-Salam is nice in that it starts off by drawing a life sketch of Imam Muslim. Then, it goes on to the introduction of Sahih Muslim by Imam Muslim himself where he explains the difference between different narrators and level of trustworthiness.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This edition is also different from other publishers in that the text is side by side with Arabic so you have access to both English and Arabic at the same time. Furthermore, the book regarding reporting from the trustworthy narrators have been placed first while other books follow it. Moreover, the Arabic text contains full chain of narrators while the English only mentions the companion. Lastly, in keeping with the tradition of high quality printing, this edition of Sahih Muslim by Dar-us-Salam Publications is second to none other & made to last a long time, Insha Allah.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">About Sahih Muslim</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The authentic hadith collections of Bukhari and Muslim are excellent in respect to both chain of transmissions and the texts as well as their general utility in that they gave guidance in almost all walks of life. The collections won the praise and acclaim of of Hadith scholars so much that they themselves produced works containing the same Ahadith as found in the collection of both Bukhari and Muslim but with their own independent chains consisting of a lesser # of sub-narrators and called their works Mustakhraj.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Imam Muslim is one of the foremost preservers of ahadith of the Prophet. His book comes second only to Sahih al Bukhari in terms of authenticity according to majority of scholars. It is considered to be better than Sahih Bukhari in terms of organization and repetition according to some scholars of Islam. It is the second in the collection of 6 books called \"Sihah Sittah\" or \"6 most authentic books\". Imam Muslim took painstaking efforts in preserving the words/actions/sayings & approvals of the Prophet. He has mostly used 4-5 narrators in the chain of transmission although there are a couple of hadith containing 3 narrators. Imam Muslim was a very good student of Imam Bukhari and some of his Shuyukhs, although he did not narrate from Imam Bukhari too much, thus reducing the numbers of narrators.</p>','Second most Authentic book of Hadith in 6 Most Authentic Books of Hadith.',1,'0',0,'131','2013-09-16 06:40:47',2,'2013-09-16 06:45:00',2),(979,'Sunan Abu Dawood (5 Vols.)','Sunan-Abu-Dawood-(5-Vols.)',57,'<p>New edition of Sunan Abu Dawood in 5 volumes by Darussalam with commentary after each hadith.

The disbeliever said to the king: \"Oh Commander of the Faithful, how will you deal with those four thousand Ahadith I have already fabricated, making lawful things unlawful, and the unlawful lawful, although not a word in those \'Ahadith was ever spoken by Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh). Thereupon, the king retorted: \"O enemy of Allah, how can you escape from Abu Ishaq Fazari and \'Abdullah bin Mubarak? They will seize them out and eliminate them letter by letter.\"</p>\r\n<p>It is a well-known fact that the painstaking efforts of scholars gave Ahadith a high degree of reliability next to Qur\'an. When the Ahadith had been read over carefully, revised, corrected and expounded in the light of the principles of Hadith sciences like Jarh (invalidation), Ta\'dil (validation), and Asma\'ur-Rijal, the stage for the recording of Ahadith was set. Thanks to the exhausting efforts of Hadith scholars and their deep sense of responsibility, the Muslim nation got, in addition to Sihah Sittah (the Sound Six books of Hadith) a vast treasure that included Musannafat (Hadith compilations according to subject-headings), Jawdmi\' (comprehensive books of Ahadith), Sunan (collections of legal and doctrinal Ahadith), Masanid (Hadith compilations according to complete chains), Ma\'ajim (compilations arranged according to names of Companions or regions or names of teachers of compilers), Mustadrakat (compilations of Ahadith meeting the conditions of other compilers but not found in their books), and Mustakhrajat (compilations containing Ahadith of other compilers with different chains of narration), the manuscripts of which numbering in thousands researched, edited and furnished with explanatory and marginal notes, exist even today in international libraries attracting the attention of research scholars. Anyhow, among those compilations, the six canonical books of Ahadith (Sihah Sittah) rank as the centerpiece.</p>\r\n<p>I have a wish since long to present the Sound Six (Sihah Sittah) translated into modem English in such a way as to list the inferences and gainful conclusions drawn from each Hadith, to remove any misgiving and misunderstanding, satisfying the mind and soul, and reinforcing the faith. With this noble cause in view, Darussalam has solicited the services of several learned scholars and researchers who are working with zeal on the translation of the Sound Six and writing commentaries on them.</p>\r\n<p>All the Ahadith of this collection have been documented, referenced and traced by the great research scholar, Hafiz Zubair \'Ali Za\'i.</p>\r\n<p>One thing I want to mention is that in these collections, the original Arabic texts of the Ahadith contain complete chain of narrators while in translation, for the sake of simplicity, only the name of the first narrator is mentioned who narrated the Hadith from the Prophet.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul-Malik Mujahid</strong><br /> <em>Managing Director, Darussalam</em></p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>','Translation and commentary of Sunan ibn Majah in English language.',1,'0',0,'135','2013-09-16 07:15:51',2,'2013-09-16 07:17:50',2),(983,'Search for Twee Twee','Search-for-Twee-Twee',57,'<p>An interesting story with illustrations for the children.

During the Prophet\'s lifetime, Abu Bakr was an exemplary soldier on the battlefield; upon the Prophet\'s death, Abu Bakr (r.a) remained steadfast and, through the help of Allah, held this nation together. When others suggested keeping Usaamah\'s army back, Abu Bakr insisted - and correctly so - that the army should continue the mission which the Prophet (pbuh) had in mind. When people refused to pay Zakaat, and when the apostates threatened the stability of the Muslim nation, Abu Bakr was the one who remained firm and took decisive action against them.

I hope to focus not just on their contributions to the vast wealth of Islamic knowledge with which Allah has blessed this nation, but also on the more private and personal aspects of their lives: their manners, their piety, and their worship. These are issues we need to learn about, for the people of this nation cannot hope to achieve a return to their past glory and honor unless they assume the qualities that, in effect, defined the Muslims of the first few generations of Islam.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sadly, many Muslims are today ignorant of even the names of our past scholars, never mind their biographies or contributions to Islam. Thus cut off from the past, many Muslims are in a state of ignorance and confusion, and seem to be waiting for someone to light up the way for them. Most people are tired of listening to speeches, and everyone wants to see people who represent, through their demeanor and deeds, a practical manifestation of the religion of Islam. One has to look far and wide to find people who fit these criteria - though we still have scholars who are noble in speech and in deed (and all praise is for Allah). But in reality, one does not have to go far to find such people, for their lives are recorded for us in history books; and here I am referring to the scholars of the early generations of Islam in particular, as well as to later scholars who followed the way of their pious predecessors.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As for the scholars to whom I am referring, Faith reached the deepest depths of their minds and hearts and flowed freely through their veins. One senses that every breath they took as well as every movement they made was for the sake of Allah. If they spoke, they spoke for the sake of Allah; and if they remained silent, that too was for the sake of Allah. They illuminated the world with their piety, worship, and deeds. If one were to study their manners and deeds, one would feel that theirs were the manners and deeds of Prophets. And if one were to read about their dealings with people, one would feel that one had come across practical demonstrations of the teachings of the Noble Qur\'an and the Sunnah of the Prophet (S) Some of my noble brothers have asked me to write a series of books in order to acquaint the general population of Muslims with their scholars. I sought help from Allah and resolved to begin that monumental task. At first, I wanted to exhaustively write about the lives of scholars, covering every aspect of their lives, and giving a detailed account of all of their scholarly activities and contributions to the Muslim nation. But the brothers who commissioned me to complete this project wanted me to present works that would be easy to read and accessible not just to students of knowledge, but also to the general population of Muslims. So I have tried, to the best of my ability, and seeking help from Allah (Azzawajal), to be as brief and concise as possible.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would like to point out that, in writing the biographies of past scholars, I have not adhered to the principles of narrator scrutiny that are applied in the sciences of Hadeeth. What I found to be famously known about past scholars, I included in this work, so long as there was no cause to doubt a particular narration. If a particular narration about a scholar was dubious in nature - it was not historically plausible, it was not widely accepted, its authenticity was challenged by learned scholars, etc. - I did not include it in any of these biographies. I thus applied the principles that were adhered to by eminent biographers of the past - the likes of Al-Haafiz Adh-Dhahabee, Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer, and Al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on them all).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Salaahud-Deen ibn Alee ibn Abdul-Maujood</strong></p>','The Biography of Imam Bukhaaree (Bukhari) (may Allah have mercy on him)',1,'0',0,'141','2013-09-18 06:08:48',218,'2013-09-26 05:09:57',2),(1000,'Imam Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj','Imam-Muslim-bin-Al-Hajjaj',57,'<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This book carries the biography of the master of the Muhaddithin, the foremost of the righteous scholars, the lofty Imam, Abu Al-Husayn Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj.

They were the scholars who devoted their entire lives to this monumental task, foregoing physical pleasures and taking delight, instead, in spending the nights recording hadeeths and in undergoing hardships in order to convey even one hadeeth from the Prophet (S).

We will focus on both general and particular aspects of these scholars\' lives, including their qualities, character, etiquette, their practice of their religion and their worship of Allah. What a need we have, particularly in this age, of such examples, for this Ummah will not have its dignity and glory restored to it until it returns to the qualities possessed by its early members and revives those traits of theirs which have passed into oblivion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Many Muslims are completely unaware of the lives of these scholars, so it\'s no surprise that non-Muslims would also be ignorant of them. As a result, the torch that might light the way forward for the bewildered and confused has gone out, leaving them waiting for someone to relight it to illuminate the path. People have grown tired of hearing about lovely ideals. They want to see concrete examples of Islam in practice as it was manifested in the lives of those great scholars and the Muslims who followed them. For them it was a reality which penetrated their hearts and minds and became part of their flesh and sinews. Their every breath, movement and moment of stillness was for Allah. If they spoke, their speech was for Allah, and if they kept silent, their silence was for Allah.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They illuminated the world with their practice of deen, their knowledge, their worship and their deeds in general. If you had looked at their conduct and character you would have seen the etiquette and character of the prophets. If you had looked at their buying, their selling and their transactions with people, you would have seen the practical embodiment of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (S). Remembrance of such people softens the hearts. That, in turn, revitalizes limbs which had fallen into disuse to start moving again to draw closer to Allah. They become inspired to catch up again with the caravan from which they had fallen behind. Look and consider, that you might benefit from the words of Mukhallad ibn Husayn.

I mentioned the reports with their sources, but I tried to avoid referencing every report in order to avoid burdening the reader with lengthy footnotes. I did not attempt to examine the chains of transmission for these reports, for I relied upon the judgment of the major hadeeth scholars, such as Dhahabee, who saw the reports fit enough to mention in their works.

Yet all of them felt that they have not given this distinguished personality the mention he rightly deserved. Imam Saeed bin Al-Musayyab was one of the pious and the righteous men.

We will focus on private and public aspects of the lives of these scholars, such as their characteristics, manners, etiquettes, knowledge, religiosity and worship. How dire our need to these qualities in this age is! For, there is no way by which this Ummah can reclaim its lost glory and strength except by adopting those qualities that were the characteristics of our predecessors, and to revive what has become extinct of these attributes.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stories of the lives of these scholars have, for some time now, become unknown to many Muslims, let alone non-Muslims. This led to the extinction of the light by which the confused find guidance. This light is waiting to be rekindled so that the path [to success in this world and the Hereafter] might continue to be illuminated. People are now fed up with mere talks. They now want to see the reality of this religion, as was the case during the time of those scholars and other Muslims who followed them.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Living the reality of this religion was an integral part of the lives of these outstanding scholars. Their breathings and movements were all for Allah. When they spoke they did so for the sake of Allah and when they kept silent, it was also for the sake of His pleasure.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">They illuminated the world with their religiosity, knowledge, worships and deeds. If you look at their conducts and manners, you would say: \'These are conducts and manners of the Prophets.\' If you read about their business transactions and their dealings with people, you would see a practical interpretation of the Qur\'an, and the reality of the Sunnah of Allah\'s Messenger, blessings and peace of Allah be upon him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, remembering these people softens the hearts and stirs up idle limbs into action for the sake of Allah. This will perhaps make you join the group of the righteous.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whenever a quality of one of the righteous people was mentioned in the presence of Makhlad ibn al-Husayn he would say: \"Do not make any mention of us while you speak about them; for a healthy person who walks is not like a crippled.\"</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whatever is written or said, qualities of these people can never be comprehensively described.

He might even not be able to stop doing so.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I have tried to compile their biographies from different sources and to bring to light what is previously unknown of their stories, so that they can serve as a guide for this Ummah and its youth who, hopefully, will emulate them and follow their path.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While doing the above, I have tried to avoid unnecessary elaboration or inappropriate brevity. I mentioned the reference of all the quotations, but did so succinctly to avoid lengthening the footnotes or boring the reader. The stories I mentioned are those authorized by the scholars, though I did not commit myself to abiding by the rules regulating the narration of hadith. If a story is recorded by erudite and trustworthy scholars like Adh-Dhahabee, I deem that an enough verification, though I avoided reprehensible stories or any story rejected by the learned scholars.

Then woe to those who disbelieve (in Allah and His Oneness Islamic Monotheism) from their Day which they have been promised (for their punishment).\" (Surah Adh-Dhdriyat, 51: 56-60)</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Islam is the religion that Allah has chosen for mankind. It is a way of life that affects every aspect of man\'s life, the social, the political, the economic, etc. Islam has a solution to every problem regardless of its nature and gravity. It is a Divine message, which Allah chose Muhammad (pbuh) to convey to mankind. Islam considers all forms of life as sacred.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this book we have tried to convey the basic rules and regulations concerning Islam.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Note from the Publisher</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This religion - Islam is a heavenly system (or regime) for all the dwellers of the earth, and it is a mighty treasure if only mankind realizes its authenticity and truth. And in what a great need the whole world is today for real understanding and thorough studying of its rules and regulations - i.e., the Noble Qur\'in and the pious Sunnah (legal ways, etc.) of the Prophet Muhammad , as these (the Qur\'an and As-Sunnah) accede to the demand of the people to know their Creator (the Almighty Allih, the Blessed, the Most High), organize and regulate the relations between them on the foundations of (Godly) Divine Justice and equality and respond to the human nature equally to that which makes sure for them their welfare (happiness) in this world and in the Hereafter (after their deaths).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And how many disasters, calamities and wars, the mankind of the whole world is suffering because of their differences in their faith, and organizations, which have broken them into the worst type of breaking, so there remains no way out for any security or any safety or any peace except with Islam, i.e., by putting in practice the Laws of their Creator, Allah, (i.e., the Qur\'an and As-Sunnah).</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Invitation to this religion - Islam is incumbent upon all those who have known it, and have enjoyed its taste and have been guided through its guidance. In fact it is a great responsibility and a trust (of Allah) over (the shoulders of) all those who know Islam, to preach it to mankind and invite them to it in a language which they speak and understand.</p>\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">A Note from the Publisher</h3>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Introduction</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who is Allah (Azawajal)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is the Noble Qur\'an?</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Authenticity of the Noble Qur\'an</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Qur\'an as a Miracle</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Qur\'an as a Comprehensive Legislation</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Science and the Noble Qur\'an</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Creation of the Heavens and the Earth</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Human Reproduction</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who is Muhammad?</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is Islam?</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Pillars of Islam</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Levels of Faith</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shahadah - Confession of a Muslim</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Salat (Prayer)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Importance of Salat</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Zakat (the poor due or obligatory Charity)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Saum (Fasting)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hajj (Pilgrimage)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The obligation of performing \'Umrah and its superiority</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Articles of Faith</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belief in Allah (Azawajal)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belief in His Angels</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belief in His Books</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belief in His Messengers</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belief in the Last Day</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Description of Paradise</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Description of Hell</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Belief in Qada\' and Qadar (the Divine Preordainment and Divine Decrees)</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Facets of Qadar</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Etiquette of Hygiene</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Women and the Family in Islam</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Dress Code for Women</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some Qur\'anic Verses about Islam</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some Ahadith about Islam</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Biblical Prophecy on the Advent of Muhammad</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah\'s Statements</li>\r\n<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Conclusion</li>\r\n</ol>','This is a perfect book for those who want to learn about Basics and Fundamentals of the Islam.',1,'0',0,'2','2013-09-23 06:05:29',218,'2013-09-23 10:40:37',2),(1033,'Why Do We Pray?','Why-Do-We-Pray?',57,'<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span>Verily, As-Salat (the prayer) prevents from Al-Fahsha (i.e. great sins of every kind, unlawful sexual intercourse, etc.) and Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism, and every kind of evil wicked deed, etc.) (29:45)</span></p>','Why Prayer five times a day is obligatory for a Muslim?

But the greatest one is the Faith of Islam bestowed to humanity. Those who have been blessed with it are actually the most fortunate persons. If one is awarded with Faith and guided to the Straight way, it matters little for him whether he has been provided with worldly blessings like wealth, power, dignity etc. or not.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Islam is highly beneficial to humanity both in this life and in the life hereafter. It is a source of goodness and virtues in this world as it guides a man to lead a righteous life, elevates the mind and moral standards, and takes him out from darkness to light. And as regards in the life hereafter, it insures for him the Paradise adorned with the articles of pleasure and delight.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The book under study \'Why Women are accepting Islam\' comprises the personal remarks and observations by those lucky women who were blessed with Islam. It has a detailed description as to how they were so impressed with Islam that obliged them to take such a major but uphill decision to abandon the religion of their forefathers. It is evident enough that Islam is the only religion which is so widely accepted by the large number of people each day.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Their opinions about veiling and other moral issues concerning mingling of both sexes freely are worth reading. They are appreciating the place of women and their importance in the Islamic society.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Compiler of this book, Mr. Muhammad Haneef Shahid is a beloved son of Pakistan, a renowned scholar, author of a number of books. He has a deep love for Islam. He has spent most of his life in the field of Learning and knowledge. He has dedicated his life to impart knowledge, especially of Islam to a wide range of people.

It is rich in information, references, bibliography, and illustrations. It has been reviewed and edited by many professors and well-educated people. It is brief and simple to read, yet contains much scientific knowledge.\r\nBrief Overview\r\n\r\nThe first chapter, Some Evidence for the Truth of Islam, answers some important questions which some people ask:\r\n\r\n    Is the Quran truly the literal word of God, revealed by Him?\r\n    Is Muhammad (S) truly a prophet sent by God?\r\n    Is Islam truly a religion from God?\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, six kinds of evidence are mentioned:\r\n\r\n    The Scientific Miracles in the Holy Quran\r\n    The Great Challenge to Produce One Chapter Like the Chapters of the Holy Quran\r\n    Biblical Prophecies on the Advent of Muhammad (S), the Prophet of Islam\r\n    The Verses in the Quran That Mention Future Events Which Later Came to Pass\r\n    Miracles Performed by the Prophet Muhammad (S)\r\n    The Simple Life of Muhammad (S)\r\n\r\nFrom these six kinds of evidence, we conclude that:\r\n\r\n    The Quran must be the literal word of God, revealed by Him.\r\n    Muhammad (S) is truly a prophet sent by God.\r\n    Islam is truly a religion from God.\r\n\r\nIf we would like to know if a religion is true or false, we should not depend on our emotions, feelings, or traditions. Rather, we should depend on our reason and intellect. When God sent the prophets, He supported them with miracles and evidence which proved that they were truly prophets sent by God and hence that the religion they came with is true.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter, Some Benefits of Islam, mentions some of the benefits that Islam provides for the individual, such as:\r\n\r\n    The Door to Eternal Paradise\r\n    Salvation from Hellfire\r\n    Real Happiness and Inner Peace\r\n    Forgiveness for All Previous Sins.\r\n\r\nThe third chapter, General Information on Islam, provides general information on Islam, corrects some misconceptions about it, and answers some commonly asked questions, such as:\r\n\r\n    What does Islam say about terrorism?\r\n    What is the status of women in Islam?','A great book for Dawah, containing basic information about Islam.

Many of these books are well written and provide an informative and comprehensive view of how Salat should be performed according to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). Unfortunately, there are very few books in English which deal with the subject in the same informative and comprehensive way. The books, which do exist, have three main disadvantages:\r\n\r\nFirstly, literature concerning Salat available in English is either so brief that it does not cover essential points in nearly enough detail, or it is so bulky and detailed that it becomes difficult to use it for quick reference, and essential points may get lost in the unnecessary detail.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the text of the Salat lacks the quality of direct research from the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). There are also books which contain material without any reference to the original sources.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the majority of books have been written according to the views held by certain schools of thought and for this reason some people hesitate to follow them.\r\n\r\nBecause of these weaknesses in existing literature in English, we felt that the need existed to produce a medium sized book on Salat which would approach the subject according to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). The Prophet, himself, said: \\\"Pray as you have seen me praying.\\\"\r\n\r\nSuch a book needs to contain all the essential details of Salat without being too bulky or complicated so that the reader can use it as a point of reference on a journey or at home.\r\n\r\nIt was also felt that a comprehensive book on Salat in English would be useful for converts to Islam and for such Muslims who do not fully understand Arabic and Urdu languages. Keeping in mind the needs of our brothers and sisters, every effort has been made to produce this book in simple and easy language.\r\n\r\nDuring our research, we sometimes found that differences occurred between established practices in various prayer books. In these circumstances we referred to authentic Ahadith of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), so that the points could be clarified as much as possible. This was, because, for a true Muslim there is no greater proof for settling arguments than authentic Ahadith and practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh).\r\n\r\nWe hope that Allah will accept this humble attempt because without His Support and Help we would never have been able to do this work. Finally, we ask all our Muslim brothers and sisters to study the text and to strive to offer Salat (prayer) according to it. If anyone finds anything unacceptable or to be against the Sunnah of the Prophet (pbuh) we would be grateful if they would inform us.','Offer Salah the way how Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) taught his Companions (r.a) to offer this obligatory worship.','en','2013-08-05 10:56:41',1,'2013-08-05 10:56:41',1),(20,698,'A Man and a Horse','Islam is a religion of peace, justice and humanism.

He was a mercy not just to believers, but to disbelievers as well, for he would invite them to come out of darkness and into the light of true guidance. He is a favor and blessing for mankind, not just the Arabs, the people among whom he was sent, but for people of all races and colors. His staunchest enemies became his closest followers when the cloud of blind prejudice was removed from their sight and when they were able, for the very first time, to see with clarity the true nature of the Prophet\\\'s character. This book deals with many of the qualities that the Prophet possessed that made him the mercy to everyone. It starts with His perfect lineage, His noble upbringing, and his fully dedicated worship. This book then gives many of the qualities of the Prophet including his generosity, humbleness, bravery, patience, and leadership to name a few. Each chapter includes examples from the life of the Prophet on how he was the perfect living example of that quality.

Besides there ware so many evils in them that it seemed as if the Jahiliyya days had come again.\r\nImam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahhab simply called people to Islam - to the Oneness of Allah and a total transformation of life in accordance with the Qur\\\'an and sunnah. In this call, it was quite natural that he had to insist on the pristine purity of Islam at the expense of polytheistic beliefs and deeds, heresies as well as innovations.\r\nMany great personalities of Islam in different parts of the world have got inspiration from the life and mission of Imam Muhammad Bin Abdul Wahhab and spread his reformative message in their lands.

Regarding this, the committee kept in mind the fact that many researchers in Muslim countries do not have available the books of the Shaikh and his written scholarly works, which would, without any doubt, have a clear effect on the shortcomings, incompleteness or mistakes of some of the things which they might write about the Shaikh\\\'s Da\\\'wah, for that reason, it was essential the genuine works of the Shaikh be available to them in an authentic form, so that they might become acquainted with the truth of his Da \\\'wah and the unbiased scholarly works which have been written about it.\r\nHence, the committee proceeded to collect all of the works of the Shaikh which they could, both printed and handwritten and to search for them in every place they could think of, with individuals belonging to the Shaikh\\\'s family, in public and private libraries and in all parts of the Kingdom and outside it. In this regard, we would like to indicate the large number of handwritten works of the Shaikh which we found in As-Sa\\\'udiyyah Library at Dukhnah, in Riyadh; the committee copied these manuscripts and they also obtained copies of the printed works of the Shaikh by purchasing them, being given them as gifts, through private connections and by borrowing some printed works which were few in number or were rare from individuals and organizations.\r\nThe Committee also published and broadcast an announcement, in which they called upon those who possessed any written or printed works of the Shaikh to present them to the Committee; and they sent letters carrying the same meaning to a number of well known personalities who had ties to him and his family, both in the Kingdom and abroad.\r\nThey also made personal contact with some individuals who had some special interest in the Shaikh, his Da\\\'wah and his written works, or who had written something of value about them. Also, during the summer vacation of the year 1396 A. H. (1976 C. E.), some members of the Committee undertook a search of some of the important libraries in Egypt and other countries in order to become acquainted with any of the works of the Shaikh which might be there and then to work on bringing whatever was possible from these works to help with the requirements of the Committee.\r\nAs a result of all this, many copies from among the works of the Shaikh were collected, both printed and handwritten and on microfilm. Then a board was appointed from among the members of the Committee to classify these works and their responsibilities included the following:\r\n1. Examining each work, whether printed or handwritten and verifying that it was really one of the works of the Shaikh. 2. Gathering all of the printed and handwritten copies and describing each copy. 3. Recording the category in which each work belonged (Aqeedah [Beliefs], Fiqh [Islamic Jurisprudence], Seerah [Biography of the Prophet (S) and treatises)\r\nAlso, a number of subcommittees were formed for the purpose of authentication and their responsibilities included the following:\r\n1. Comparing the printed and handwritten copies of each book with each other in order to obtain a complete copy, which could be prepared for printing. 2. Numbering the Qur\\\'anic Verses, mentioning the Surahs from which they came and adding the diacritical marks to them. 3. Adding punctuation and paragraphs and making the chapter headings stand out, in accordance with the modern system of writing and printing. 4. Ascertaining the authenticity of works presented to the board of classification whose attribution to the Shaikh was in doubt. The Conference Committee took great care that every one of the authentication subcommittees was composed of specialized scholars with a strong connection to the type and nature of the work which they were reviewing.

In fact, the Prophet, said that prayers are the worship itself, or to be exact, the main part of it.\r\nAllah likes that His creatures worship Him and pray to Him, because the worship and the prayers are the physical and practical way of declaring our faith and creed that Allah alone has created us and only He is to be worshipped.\r\nAllah has prescribed for us the ways and acts of worship. As Allah does not burden His creatures more than they could bear, the prescribed acts of worship are the minimum one should perform. But to get nearer to Allah and to attain His Pleasure, we should do something more than the prescribed acts. In this regard the prayers and supplications are the most easy acts of worship for us to adopt. We are fortunate that the Prophet has guided us about how to pray and has taught us the supplications we should make on various occasions.\r\nIn this book, the emphasis is on the style so that the children can easily understand the significance of prayers and supplications.

The Sealed Nector was honored by the World Muslim League as first prize winner book. Whoever wants to know the whole life style of the Prophet in detail must read this book. Muhammad (pbuh) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him, are severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurah (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (Paradise). (Al-Fath: 29) The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth. Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah\'s Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet) and learns and then teaches it to others. The (last example is that of a) person who does not care for it and does not take Allah\'s Guidance revealed through me (he is like that barren land).\" (Al-Mukarramah) Note: The main difference between the different sizes is the cover and the size of the text.</p>\r\n<h3>Publishers Note:</h3>\r\n<p>The heart of every Muslim is filled with love for the last Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and this love of the messenger of Allah is an asset for him. Love and respect of a person depends on the benefits we get from him, As the Prophet , is the greatest benefactor of humanity, every Muslim has deepest love for him, Every deed of his life is to be followed by every individual of the Muslim Ummah. Highest love for the Prophet (pbuh) is made a test of our Faith. Allah the All-Mighty has described and explained the status of Muhammad (pbuh) in the Qur\'an: \"Say (O Muhammad (pbuh) to mankind): If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic monotheism, follow the Qur\'an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you...\" (3:31) Love of Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh) is a part of our Faith. There is a Hadith (narration) of the Prophet (pbuh) who said: \"None of you has Faith unless I am dearer to him than his father and his son and all mankind.\" In the early period of Islam, many books were written on the life of the Prophet (pbuh) in the Qur\'an itself, the best example of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), has also been mentioned, The Qur\'an says: \"And verily, you (O Muhammad (pbuh) are on an exalted standard of character.\" (68:4) Someone asked \'Aishah (R) about the noble character and manners of the Prophet (pbuh). She answered: \"Have you not read the Qur\'an? His character is a complete explanation of the Qur\'an.\" It means that whatever is commanded and prohibited in the Qur\'an, its practical example is present in the manners of Muhammad In other words, the ideal and perfect example of good manners and character which the Qur\'an demands from mankind, was present in the person of Muhammad in its highest degree. Scholars of Ahadith (traditions) and writers of the biography of Muhammad , the Messenger of Allah, have explored his life from every angle and aspect from birth to death. Every event, every incident of his life has been described and narrated, but none had claimed that he has given his life\'s recording its full rights. Hundreds of books have been written on the life of Muhammad and this endeavor will continue till the Day of Resurrection. No doubt The Sealed Nectar (Ar-Raheeq AI-Makhturn) is a book of great value and praiseworthy work on the life of Muhammad. This book has been written by the Eminent Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri of Jamiah Salafiyah, Banaras (India). The first Islamic Conference on Seerah (biography of the Prophet) was held in 1976 in Pakistan sponsored by the Muslim World League. The League announced a world contest for writing a book on the life of the Prophet. One hundred fifty thousand Saudi Riyals (SR 150,000) (forty thousand U.S. Dollars) was the grand prize for the best five books. One hundred and seventy-one manuscripts were received from all over the world. Out of these, eighty-five were in the Arabic Language, sixty-four in Urdu, twenty-one were in English and one in French and Hausa. A board of highly qualified scholars judged the manuscripts and announced the results. The manuscript of Shaikh Safiur-Rahman Mubarakpuri, Jamiah Salafiyah Banaras (India), author of the book in hand (The Sealed Nectar) received first the grand prize of SR 50,000 (fifty thousand Saudi Riyals) for its authentic and sound collections of the narrations. Dr. Majid Ali Khan, New Delhi, India, placed second. The third prize went to Dr. Naseer Ahmed, Islamic University, Lahore, Pakistan. The fourth prize was awarded to Mr. Harnid Mahmud of Egypt. The fifth and final prize was awarded to Abdus-Salam Hashim of Madinah Munawwarah. An extravagant prize distribution ceremony was held at Makkah Al-Mukarramah on 12 Rabi\'ul-Awwal 1399 A.H. (1979 C.E.). Afterwards, the book was published by the Muslim World League and then many other organizations gained the honor of publishing this masterpiece. Darussalam also published this book in the Arabic language. I had wished to publish this book in the English language for the wider benefit of humanity. Shaikh Safiur-Rahman willingly agreed to the idea and consented to publish the English translation. The stage of translation was traversed with the help of brother Mahir Abu Dhahab, owner and general manager of Markaz Noor Ash-Sham in Damascus, Syria. For the first edition of this book, brother Mahir Abu Dhahab from Syria, Damascus, provided his help and cooperation as regards the translation work for which I offer my special thanks to him. Now in your hands is the new revised edition with many changes and additions. Brother Abu Khaliyl (U.S.A.) amended and improved the translation to make its language simple and easy, besides comparing again from the beginning to the end the English translation with the Arabic revised text to update the changes therein. So, after a coherent toil of months, this edition was published. (All praise is for Allah).

One of the bright sides of this Book is that it is read and recited much more than any other book of the world. In a real sense this very Book has encircled into it the ever shining pearls of all the visible and invisible knowledge and the wisdom, the world needs for survival and eternal success. Hence the reading of the Qur\'an, understanding of its meanings and interpretations is important and obligatory on all the followers of Islam.</p>\r\n<p>Muslim Community should be proud for having the last Divine Book in a well-preserved form. This blessed opportunity has not been provided to any other heavenly religion. Before the revelation of the Qur\'an, hundred of Scriptures including the three former heavenly Books as well have been annihilated. Whatever they have at hand as they disclose are nothing but only the Collections of narratives and sayings of spiritual guides. On the other hand, today the Noble Qur\'an has its originality as it was, in the hearts of thousands of the memorizers (Huffaz) of the Qur\'an. As regards to its manuscripts written from time to time in various periods, their samples are available even today and found in museums, government under-taken libraries as well as many of the private libraries and various publication institutes at large scales. After revelation of the Qur\'an, various artifice skills developed. Besides its modulation forms, some of them pertained to its literal terms - explanatory points, religious decrees, themes, topic and issue discussions etc. But along with these skills, other techniques and arts such as calligraphy, designing, printing, binding, etc., also developed.</p>\r\n<p>Later on the reference of the Qur\'anic geography, descriptions of the Prophets, the Qur\'anic habitations, the Qur\'anic landmarks etc., were described in scores of the books, by the end of 20th century. But in the third millennium of the world civilization, these descriptions appeared on surface in the form of a new way of \'understanding the Qur\'an\'. For the first time an effort has been made to bring out the places, the same time, I decided, considering it a valuable presentation, that our institution, Darussalam, would certainly bring out its Urdu and English editions.</p>\r\n<p>So, a contact was made with Dar Al-Fikr, Damascus - the publisher of Atlas of the Qur\'an, but they refused. Then some common friends were asked to do something in this regard, and the publisher was addressed through a letter also, but nothing could be finalized. Last year, Mr. Hasan Salim, the son of Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim, owner of Dar Al-Fikr, came to Riyadh. He visited the offices of Darussalam and was very much impressed after knowing about the aims and objects of Darussalam and its efforts for the spread of Islamic knowledge, he promised to have a talk with his father regarding the publication of the Atlas of the Qur\'an.</p>\r\n<p>In the beginning of the year 2003, 1 specially went to Damascus, which is like a second home to me. In the past ten or twelve years, I must have gone there at least 30 or 35 times. In Damascus, the second name of Darussalam is Darul Fika\'. Its owner, Mr. Muhammad Yasir Tabba\' is dear to me like a younger brother. After reaching Damascus, I informed my hosts that the only purpose of my visit is to have a conversation with Dar Al-Fikr regarding the books Atlas of the Qur\'an and the Atlas on the Prophet\'s Biography. The next day we were at the offices of Dar Al-Fikr. Mr. Hasan Salim greeted me heartily. I started talking him about the books again. He proposed to have a talk with his father who was a very busy person. I asked for a few minutes talk with him. His secretary agreed to allow us time for a short talk reminding about the appointments previously assigned.</p>\r\n<p>The meeting that was scheduled to be of a short duration, exceeded one hour and a half until the secretary of Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim interrupted to remind about the visitors that were waiting.</p>\r\n<p>Dar Al-Fikr was established 50 years ago. Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim has passed 70 years of life, having a very good health by the grace of Allah and running the organization with full enthusiasm. He told me about the visit of Maulana Maudoodi to Damascus in 1960 and that the Maulana paid a visit to his house for a social call. Mr. Muhammad Adnan Salim had arranged a dinner for his reception and invited prominent scholars and writers in it. We were engrossed in the past memories. He has a wide experience of publishing books and is personalities and nations etc., as indicated in the Qur\'an, in the form of a unique presentation comprising maps, photographs and tables. This great endeavor is Atlas of the Qur\'an by a prominent research scholar of geography and an Arabian renowned figure, Dr Shawqi Abu Khalil. For the interpretation and explanation of the religious books, the ancient and modern orientalists have done a notable work, and whatever work they did, it is of course a landmark for other research scholars. The habitations and personalities mentioned in Torah, or the land marks, places and personalities mentioned in four books of New Testament are available (in a beautiful manner) in more than a dozen geographical books with maps, known as atlas. But in various chapters of the Qur\'an, the descriptions replete with the events of the Hijaz, Arab nations, places, personalities, oceans, rivers, gulfs, lakes, mountains, forests, caves, cities etc., are available and hundreds of the writers, scholars and authors have also gone through their details, and many of the research books have also been compiled on these topics, but on the other hand, all this fruitful information has yet not been presented in the form of a book (atlas) consisting of maps, photographs and tables. These concerned contents or literary compositions containing the Qur\'anic maps and tables were not before me so that a reciter of the Qur\'an may think of the details of the indications found in the Qur\'an while reciting it.</p>\r\n<p>Since the dawn of the establishment of Darussalam, the multilingual institution for the publication of the Qur\'an and the Qur\'anic sciences and ideologies, we have been on the line of our objectives, i.e., the circulation & publication of the Qur\'an in various languages with its ideologies in scientific manner. In this regard, we keeping in view the modern opportunities, are applying all kinds of modern scientific means and techniques in the teaching & the publication of the Qur\'an. Being an ordinary student of the Qur\'an, it has been my sincere effort to bring out the books (published in Arabic language) on teaching of the Qur\'an, teaching of Hadith, biography of the Messenger into the Urdu, English and other languages. Then after two and half years ago, when I went through the great work: (Atlas of the Qur\'an: Places, Nations, Landmarks) by the distinguished author of Arabic language, Dr Shawqi Abu Khalil, I found it adorned with colored maps besides the Qur\'anic topics and Verses. I was happily surprised and impressed after looking through its pages, and then at<br />well known in the Islamic world. He provided me valuable guidance as regards the publishing field.</p>\r\n<p>However, this meeting ended upon the permission to print both of the books. It was decided that Darussalam will pay regular royalty on them and some money will be paid as advance. Thanks are to Allah that after some weeks when he visited Riyadh to participate in a conference of writers, an agreement was signed between us, and so I was able to fulfill the wish I was most eager of. I am thankful to Mr. Muhammad Adrian Salim for his cooperation and permission to publish the translations of the books.</p>\r\n<p>It may be perceived that the compilation of the Qur\'anic Atlas consisting of personalities, nations, events and landmarks, places etc., as mentioned in the Qur\'an, was not an easier task. Certainly the author might have made a journey toward the passed period, and imaginarily perceived the pictures of the events mentioned in the Noble Qur\'an. It seems in the journey to the past, other heavenly books, history, narratives and the modern archaeological studies were also proved helpful to this great writer. Certainly this journey in the back direction consisting of several periods would have been a typical and unique experience of his life, but this experience itself is one of the best rewards of the struggles the author did. Having a dip in the ocean of this beautiful experience, the writer has compiled both of his atlases. I am sure that both of them would open for the readers the channel of intelligence and spiritual journey which the author found.</p>\r\n<p>Now the work on the other valuable presentation: Atlas on the Prophet\'s Biography is under process, and Insha Allah with high standards of printing and designing, it will soon be in the hands of the readers.</p>\r\n<p>The readers are humbly requested to accept from us this unique presentation, and pray to Allah for us to be more active in the struggle towards the multilingual publications of much needed books, treatises etc., based on Islam.<br />May Allah bless us with splendid success.</p>\r\n<p><em>Abdul-Malik Mujahid</em><br />General Manager Darussalam, Riyadh, KSA</p>','An Authentic Collection of the Qur\'anic Information with Maps, Tables and Pictures.','en','2013-08-05 10:56:41',1,'2013-08-05 10:56:41',1),(47,725,'Basic Principles of Islam','<p>Following most basic and important topics about Islam are explained in this book in a very simple way:<br />Islam</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Islam</li>\r\n<li>Allah</li>\r\n<li>Prophet Muhammad (Allah\'s peace & blessings upon him)</li>\r\n<li>Iman (Belief)</li>\r\n<li>The Noble Quran</li>\r\n<li>The Five Pillars of Islam: Shahadah, Prayer, Zakat, Fasting, Hajj (Pilgrimage)</li>\r\n<li>The Mosque</li>\r\n<li>Manners of a Muslim</li>\r\n</ol>','This small colorful booklet goes over all the basics of Islam.

He is the God of Prophet Moses (pbuh), Prophet Jesus (pbuh), Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and all the other Prophets. The name \'Allah\' is not a new name, but rather the true name of God. It is used by Muslims as well as Arabic-speaking Christians.</p>\r\n<p>... and say: \"We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you (Jews and Christians); our God and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted (as Muslims).\" (Qur\'an, 29:46)</p>\r\n<h3>What is the Qur\'an?</h3>\r\n<p>The Qur\'an is the literal Word of Allah revealed to His Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), through the angel Gabriel, about fourteen hundred years ago. The Qur\'an is the eternal miracle of Islam. Allah has challenged mankind to produce anything to match it or even match one short chapter of it, yet no human has ever been able to meet the challenge.</p>\r\n<p>And if you are in doubt about what We have revealed to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a chapter of the like thereof, and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allah if you are truthful. (Qur\'an, 2:23)</p>\r\n<p>Since the Qur\'an is the literal Word of Allah, it exists only in its original Arabic in which it was revealed, and cannot be translated into another language. However, for the benefit of those who do not speak Arabic, the meanings of the Qur\'an can be translated. Therefore, the quotations in this book are not the Qur\'an but only translations of its meanings.</p>\r\n<h3>What Does the Word \'Islam\' Mean?</h3>\r\n<p>The word \'Islam\' means the conscious and peaceful obedience and submission to the Will of the only true God, \'Allah\'. All religions were named either after their founders or after nations or tribes e.g. Buddhism, Hinduism, Judaism and Christianity, while the name \'Islam\' is not associated with any person, tribe or nation but was given by Allah in the Qur\'an:</p>\r\n<p>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favor upon you and have chosen for you Islam as your religion. (Qur\'an, 5:3)</p>\r\n<p>The word \'Muslim\' is a description; anyone who submits himself to Allah\'s Will and obeys Him is a Muslim.<br />All the Prophets were Muslims because they obeyed Allah and submitted themselves to His Will. Furthermore, the true followers and companions of those Prophets were Muslims:</p>\r\n<p>Then when Jesus came to know of their disbelief, he said: \"Who will be my helpers in Allah\'s cause?\" The disciples said: \"We are the helpers of Allah (i.e. we will strive in His cause); we believe in Allah, and bear witness that we are Muslims (i.e. we submit to Allah). Our Lord! We believe in what You have sent down and we follow the Messenger (Jesus) SO write us down among those who bear witness.\" (Qur\'an, 3:52, 53)</p>\r\n<p>Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said: \"Both in this world and in the Hereafter, I am the nearest of all people to Jesus - the son of Mary. The Prophets are paternal brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one (Islamic Monotheism).\" (Bukhari)</p>\r\n<h3>Early Muslims</h3>\r\n<p>Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and all the other Prophets from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them) were sent with the same Message, to command human beings to worship Allah alone, and<br />not to join in worship partners with him. Prophet Jesus (pbuh) never claimed divinity. He taught the Oneness of Allah and confirmed that he was just a Messenger:</p>\r\n<p>Jesus said, \"... I am returning to my Father and your Father, to my. God and your God.\" (John 20:17)<br />By myself I can do nothing; I judge only as I hear, and my judgment is just, for I seek not to please myself but him who sent me. (John 5:30)</p>\r\n<p>The disciples followed the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). They worshiped Allah alone and kept religion pure for Him. They believed and supported Prophet Jesus (pbuh) to such an extent that Allah held them up as an excellent example to Muslims in the Qur\'an:</p>\r\n<p>O you who believe! Be you helpers (in the cause) of Allah as said Jesus - son of Mary, to the disciples: \"Who will be my helpers in Allah\'s cause?\" The disciples said: \"We are the helpers of Allah (i.e. we will strive in His cause)! Then a group of the Children of Israel believed and a group disbelieved. So, We gave power to those who believed against their enemies, and they became the victorious. (Qur\'an, 61:14)</p>\r\n<p>Jesus the merciful Prophet (pbuh) commanded his disciples to be kind and merciful and to forgive others. Let the Qur\'an now describe the followers of Prophet Jesus (pbuh):</p>\r\n<p>Then, We sent after them Our Messengers, and We sent Jesus - son of Mary, and gave him the Injeel (Gospel), and placed compassion and mercy in the hearts of those who followed him. (Qur\'an, 57:27)</p>\r\n<p>Verily, you will find the strongest among mankind in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are idolaters and you will find the nearest in love to the believers those who say: \"We are Christians.\" That is because amongst them are priests and monks, and they are not arrogant. (Qur\'an, 5:82)</p>\r\n<p>After the Ascension of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) to heaven, most of the Christians remained Unitarian. They used to believe in the Oneness of Allah following the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and all the other Prophets. They did not believe in the doctrines of Trinity, Original Sin, Blood Atonement or Divine Sonship of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). After centuries of persecution against the Unitarian Christians, the Pauline Church prevailed and the teachings of Paul replaced the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and Paul became the real founder of today\'s Christianity.</p>\r\n<p>Paul, the self-appointed thirteenth apostle who never saw Jesus (pbuh), wrote more Books of the Bible than any other author, while Prophet Jesus (pbuh) did not write a single word, as the original Gospel revealed by Allah to Jesus (pbuh) was lost. However, Paul replaced the Gospel of Jesus (pbuh) with a gospel written by him and invented the doctrines of Original Sin, Blood Atonement and Divine Sonship of Prophet Jesus (pbuh). With the exception of few verses, all the verses in Paul\'s letters are his own words and not the words of Prophet Jesus (pbuh):</p>\r\n<p>Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to my (Paul) gospel. (2 Timothy 2:8) (KJV) After the loss of the original Gospel of Prophet Jesus (pbuh), many gospels were written. These gospels include some of the genuine teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) mixed with people\'s own texts and interpretations which were influenced by the beliefs of that period. Therefore, it became difficult and sometimes impossible to know which parts came from Allah and which from people. As a result, Christians deviated from the teachings of Prophet Jesus (pbuh) and followed the teachings of hundreds of monks and priests which resulted in hundreds of religious groups having different beliefs.</p>\r\n<h3>The Effects of the Contradictions in the Bible</h3>\r\n<p>The errors and contradictions in the Bible make some Christians reject Christianity and view the Bible as merely a historical book. Those people continue their disbelief to the extent that they deny the existence of God and consequently, they do not believe in all the Prophets including Prophet Jesus (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>Those people shock the Muslim more than anyone else, because no Muslim is a Muslim if he or she does not believe in Jesus Christ (pbuh). The Muslim, in compliance with the Qur\'an, believes that Jesus (pbuh) was a great Messenger of Allah, that he brought the dead to life by Allah\'s leave, that he healed those born blind and the lepers by Allah\'s leave, that he was born without any male intervention and that he was the Christ.</p>\r\n<p>It is true that the errors and contradictions in the Bible mean that the Word of Allah has been mixed with people\'s texts and interpretations. However, they do not mean that Prophet Jesus (pbuh) was a liar or that Allah does not exist! They do not mean that Muhammad (pbuh) was a false prophet or that Islam is not the true religion!</p>\r\n<h3>The Purpose of this Book</h3>\r\n<p>The purpose of this book is to achieve the following objectives using the Qur\'an and what survived in the Bible from the teachings of the Prophets (peace be upon them), with the help of our common sense, reason and intellect:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To confirm that Prophet Jesus (pbuh) was a great Messenger of Allah, that he was the Christ, that he was given the Gospel, that he was born miraculously without a father and that he gave life to the dead by Allah\'s leave and healed him who was born blind and the leper by Allah\'s leave.</li>\r\n<li>To confirm that the original Gospel revealed to Prophet Jesus (pbuh) was lost and that the existing gospels include few parts of that original Gospel mixed with people\'s texts and interpretations, which contain a lot of errors and contradictions.</li>\r\n<li>To disprove misrepresentations and lies in the Bible against Allah.</li>\r\n<li>To disprove false charges in the Bible against the Prophets, Lot, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon, and Job (peace be upon them).</li>\r\n<li>To disprove false charges in the Bible against Prophet Jesus (pbuh).</li>\r\n<li>To point out the wrong beliefs which were added (intentionally or unintentionally) into the message of Prophet Jesus (pbuh).

And verily, Allah is with the Muhsinun (good doers).\" (29:69)</li>\r\n<li>\"And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e., death).\" (15:99)</li>\r\n<li>\"And remember the Name of your Lord and devote yourself to Him with a complete devotion.\" (73:8)</li>\r\n<li>\"So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant), shall see it.\" (99:7)</li>\r\n<li>\"And whatever good you send before you for yourselves, (i.e., Nawafil - non-obligatory acts of worship: prayers, charity, fasting, Hajj and Umrah etc.), you will certainly find it with Allah, better and greater in reward\" (73:20)</li>\r\n<li>\"And whatever you spend in good, Allah knows it well.\" (2:273)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Hadith 95:</h3>\r\n<p>Narrated Abu Hurairah (ra) Messenger (pbuh) said, \"Allah the Exalted has said: \'I will declare war against him who shows hostility to a pious worshipper of Mine. And the most beloved thing with which My slave comes nearer to Me is what I have enjoined upon him; and My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (prayer or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) till I love him. When I love him I become his hearing with which he hears, his seeing with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks; and if he asks (something) from Me, I give him, and if he asks My Protection (refuge), I protect him.\"\' [Al-Bukhari]</p>\r\n<h3>Commentary:</h3>\r\n<p>Those who make innovations in religion and associate partners with Allah (such as Haluli -who believe in the indwelling light in the soul of man, Wajudi - who believe in the physical form of Allah, and pagans who worship other than Allah) interpret this Hadith in support of their base contention and thus seek support of one wrong from another although the meaning and interpretation of the Hadith is not at all what the describe. In simple and unambiguous terms, the Hadith means that when a person adds voluntary prayers to the obligatory ones, he becomes a favorite slave of Allah and on account of it, he receives special help from Allah. Then he is protected by Allah to the extent that He supervises every organ of his body. Thus, he is saved from disobedience of Allah. He bears what is hiked by Allah, sees what is liked by Him, handles what pleases Him. When he attains that lofty position of love and obedience of Allah then Allah in return also grants prayers of His obedient and loyal slaves.</p>\r\n<p>A saint is not one who has a peculiar get up and appearance, or who occupies the seat of a saint as his successor, or a person who is lost in meditation, or a half-mad, or one who has invented his own style of remembrance and worship of Allah, but it is one who strictly fulfills the obligations imposed by Islam, is fond of voluntary prayers and adheres to Divine injunctions in every walk of life.</p>\r\n<p>The love of such saints is a means to attain the Pleasure of Allah, and enmity (hatred and repulsion) with them is a cause of His serious displeasure and wrath.</p>\r\n<p>Voluntary prayer is certainly a means of attaining the Pleasure of Allah, but it must be preceded by the fulfillment of obligatory prayers.

May Allah\'s peace and blessing be upon His final Prophet and Messenger, Muhammad, his family and his Companions.</p>\r\n<p>Darussalam is pleased to present this valuable book, \'Commanders of the Muslim Army (Among the Companions of the Prophet (pbuh))\' compiled in the Urdu language, by a great scholar and a compiler of Islamic books, Mahmood Ahmad Ghadanfar and translated by our Islamic sister Jamila Muhammad Qawi.</p>\r\n<p>This book is about the life stories of the Prophet\'s Companions who led the Muslim army that was trained by the Messenger of Allah (pbuh)\". Once during the training when the Prophet asked about the strategy to adopt in the battle, one of his Companion, \'Asim bin Thabit (R) had stood up with his bow in his hand and replied:</p>\r\n<p>\"When the enemy is a hundred yards away, we will use our bows and arrows; when the enemy comes closer, we will fight with our spears; when the spears break, we will have a hand to hand combat with our swords.\"</p>\r\n<p>When the Prophet (pbuh) heard this, he said:</p>\r\n<p>\"Doubtless this was the way to fight a battle. Whoever wishes to take part in a battle should adopt the strategy of \'Asim bin Thabat.\"</p>\r\n<p>These great martial Commanders improved upon and developed the strategies and principles first enunciated by the Prophet (pbuh). They loved death more than life in their pursuit of the righteous and true religion, therefore sometimes the opposing forces were ten times larger than the Muslim army and with superior arms, yet most often it were the forces of Islam which were victorious. Therefore the Prophet (pbuh) gave some of them the title of Saifullah (Sword of Allah) and the title of Lion of Allah.</p>\r\n<p>After the death of the Prophet (pbuh), the empire of Islam spread over an area of ten hundred thousand square miles. We should have to study inevitably the lives of these remarkable military leaders if we are deeply interested in learning about the Islamic history.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;Pray to Allah the Almighty that He grants them all - the writer, translator and editor and everyone else who participated by any means - the best reward in this world and in the Hereafter, for having supported in the completion of such a valuable book. Ameen.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>General Manager Darussalam</em></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Preface</h3>\r\n<p>All Praise is for Allah Almighty and may Allah Bless the Prophet, his family and his Companions.</p>\r\n<p>This book is about the lives of those pre-eminent and noble Companions of the Prophet who led the forces of Islam in the violent and strife-torn arenas of conflict against the Kuffar or disbelievers. These were the warriors who after a vigorous training had turned to pure gold after being trained by the supreme Commander, the mercy to mankind, and the embodiment of goodness, the king of Al Madinah, Muhammad (pbuh). Experts in the art of war were amazed and overwhelmed when they studied their exploits of bravery and valor. They struck terror in the hearts of the enemy and the stronghold sand palaces of Qaesar and Kisra trembled before their might.</p>\r\n<p>They lived in austerity and simplicity, yet their style was regal. They were not cowed down by the enemy, they did not tremble before him in terror, neither could they be deterred from the pursuit of their objective. They loved death more than life in their pursuit of the righteous and true. Their gaze was modest, their hearts burned with passionate love of Allah Almighty, their arms were powerful and their feet stood surprisingly firm and steady as they fought for what their conscience told them was moral and virtuous. In whichever direction they turned, they conquered region after region. Under the leadership of the Prophet (pbuh) they performed stunning deeds of valor and daring in the battlefields. In no time at all the stories of their great and noble exploits became the assurances of their bravery and the tales of their heroism were guarantees of their fervor and ardor. These epic stories spread in all directions. The battles fought during the Prophet\'s time were the most excellent and exemplary in all respects. Many time the forces of Islam faced armies which were much larger. Sometimes the opposing forces were ten times larger than the Prophet\'s army, and also had a larger number of superior arms and equipment, yet most often it was the forces of Islam which were victorious. Sociologists are amazed by the fact that the Islamic state started off as a small city state and, expanded at an average rate of two hundred square miles per day. Ten years later at the death of the Prophet (pbuh) the empire of Islam was spread over an area of ten hundred thousand square miles.</p>\r\n<p>When one studies the Islamic era spanning the lifetime of the Prophet (pbuh) from the point of view of conquest and occupation of lands, their organization, management and administration, this amazement subsides. Every stage and step seems to have been patterned according to a well-defined, comprehensive and well thought out plan.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>&nbsp;Stability of the conquered lands.</li>\r\n<li>Education, moral and religious training of the conquered peoples.</li>\r\n<li>The education and training of the managers and administrators in morals, intellect and skills.</li>\r\n<li>An attempt to extend the limits of the Islamic Empire, by training military experts. This training was moral and intellectual. Technical know - how was not neglected either. Under their leadership the Islamic army forged their way into new territories in all directions; these were basic, innovative and revolutionary steps that resulted in astounding exploits. As a result within the short span of fifteen years after the passing away of the Prophet (pbuh) most of the areas of the two major continents of Asia and Africa, were under the control of the Muslims.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>When a student of Islamic history observes these facts, he is inevitably and deeply interested to learn about the lives of these remarkable military leaders. He would like to study their characters, their code of life and the strategies they employed. He would like to gain enlightenment from these beacons of the past in order to illuminate such light as make the world of Islam shine in the present, and also to blaze a trail for future generations.</p>\r\n<p>Human nature and the basic strategies of war normally do not change; it is for this reason that invaluable lessons can be gained even from the battles fought far back in ancient recorded history. With this purpose in mind biographical sketches of these great generals of the early years of Islam are being presented; their incredible and extraordinary military achievements have added many a glorious and golden chapter to the history of mankind.</p>\r\n<p>Doubtless those great personalities who were trained by the greatest Commander of Arab and Ajam, the Sultan of Al-Madinah, the Prophet (pbuh) himself, had been transformed by personal contact with his radiant personality. Their eyes witnessed his greatness, which had become the axis of their hearts souls and very existence. The only meaning and purpose of their lives was to achieve martyrdom in the cause of Islam. A study of the enviable lives and characters of these great generals will inspire modern day Mujdhideen<sup>[1]</sup> soldiers and military leaders with the spirit of sacrifice and Jihad<sup>[2]</sup>. The battles fought during the life of the Prophet (pbuh) introduced and made crystal-clear such principles of military strategy as had never been used in human history. The brilliance of the strategies the Prophet (pbuh) used as the Commander-in-Chief in the battle of Badr cannot be or ignored even in the context of modern day warfare. The very first martial tactics employed by the small Islamic State in its infancy were remarkably well organized and disciplined, for the example:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Before leaving for the battlefield a Deputy was appointed in Al-Madinah.</li>\r\n<li>The Muslim army was divided into different groups or divisions and a commander was appointed for each of these divisions.</li>\r\n<li>Qais Al Mazni Ansari was appointed to watch over the rear section of the army.</li>\r\n<li>The Muslim army reached the battlefield of Badr first and took control of the stream there, so that the enemy could not face the Muslim army for long without water.</li>\r\n<li>Even before the battle started, it was realized that the group formation of the Muslim army should be given a great deal of attention. This was because the opposing army outnumbered them three to one.</li>\r\n<li>After the formation the Prophet (pbuh) ordered that no Mujahid should take any step on his own, and must wait for orders from him.</li>\r\n<li>He ordered that the Mujahideen should shoot their arrows only when the enemy came within range; if he was beyond their range they should not shoot. This was to avoid wastage of arms and equipment. If the enemy was very close then they should fight with their spears; if they were even closer then they should use their swords to defend themselves.</li>\r\n<li>On one occasion he pointed out to his army that they should be aware that the most effective strength and strategy lay in the practice of Rummi. This meant to practice the art of throwing. This covers all kinds of weapons of war, which are either thrown or shot. Missiles, bombs or cannons from which shots are fired - all belong to this category of weapons. Even in the changed war scenario of today, the principle of Rummi is of prime importance; as this is where the real strength of an army lies. This principle and its significant contribution to the victory and might of a military force was first enunciated by the Prophet (pbuh). The degree of superiority and dominance of one country over another is in direct proportion to its strength and power.</li>\r\n<li>In the battle of Badr a special covered platform was erected for the Prophet , at the rear of the place where the army was deployed. The rules and principles of warfare were promulgated and declared. Women, children, people not taking part in active warfare and all senior citizens were not to be killed or harmed in any way.</li>\r\n<li>In the battle of Uhud, the Prophet (pbuh), inspected the battlefield and</li>\r\n<li>sensing the various possibilities of danger, posted a squad of fifty archers on a mountain. They were ordered to stick to their positions under all circumstances. The vital importance of this positioning was realized when the enemy, finding this strategic position unoccupied unexpectedly attacked the Muslim army and caused significant damage.</li>\r\n<li>In the battle of Ahzab, the digging of the trenches gave total protection from the enemy to Islam\'s first capital, Al-Madinah. This innovative and unusual move of digging trenches around a city for the purpose of protecting it astonished Abu Sufyan, the Commander of the enemy forces. Trenches are today an integral and important part of defensive fortification strategy.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;All these steps enumerated above were basically innovative military strategies, which were probably introduced for the first time in human history. This book recounts the amazing exploits of the great heroes who led the first Islamic forces in battle, and had been trained by the Prophet (pbuh). An experienced enemy and leader like Wrath Abu Sufyan had been nonplused by these innovative measures. These great martial heroes of Islam improved upon and developed the strategies and principles first enunciated by the Prophet. Even in a state of war they did not lose sight of the great moral and ethical values taught them by the Prophet (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>Pray to Allah Almighty that He grant abundant Divine Guidance to the military experts, generals, the young soldiers and Mujahideen to follow in the footsteps of these great Companions and generals and bring back the past glories of Islam.</p>\r\n<p>May Allah Almighty Shower His Blessings on the Prophet (pbuh) and his Companions!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mahmood Ahmad Ghadanfar</strong></p>\r\n<p>--</p>\r\n<p><sup><span>[1]</span></sup>&nbsp;Mujdhideen - Those who fight in a war for Islam.

Since the Qur\'an is the primary source of Islamic teachings, the correct understanding for the Qur\'an is necessary for every Muslim.

Abu Al-Fida\' \'Imad Ad-Din Isma\'il bin \'Umar bin Kathir Al-Qurashi Al-Busrawi (d. 774 H.), is the most popular interpretation of the Qur\'an in the Arabic language, and the majority of the Muslims consider it to be the best source based on Qur\'an and Sunnah. This Arabic work spans three thousand and two hundred pages in four volumes. To cover all of the references, Ibn Kathir has also collected some weak Ahadith and Israelitish stories. Some repetitions also occur in it, as and when the topics required these.</p>\r\n<p>As Darussalam has made a policy to publish only such works which are based on Qur\'an and authentic Ahadith we appointed a board of Islamic scholars to summarize Tafsir Ibn Kathir in the original Arabic language. Shaykh Abu Al-Ashbal Ahmad Shagif of Rabitah Al-\'Alam Al-Islami, Makkah, and Shaykh Safi-ur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri, Head of the Research Committee of Darussalam worked with a team of other scholars for about two years on this project. We published this summarized version in the Arabic language titled as Al-Misbah Al-Murur fe Tahdhib Tafsir Ibn Kathir.</p>\r\n<p>This summarized version was prepared for the sole purpose of translation into all the major languages of the world. First of all, it is being presented in the English language as it is the most widely written and spoken in the world.</p>\r\n<p>To translate a book in another language is a task requiring great skill, and when it comes to the translation of Tafsir and Hadith, then it becomes a greater responsibility, requiring the skills of both languages and the knowledge of religion and religious terms. The help, advice, guidance and cooperation of many persons was sought for the various steps of the project. The translation was done by Mr. Jalal Abualrub (USA), Mr. Nasir Khitab, his wife Mrs. Huda Khitab (Canada), Mr. Aqeel Walker (USA), Dr. Muhammad Al-Jibali (USA) and Mr. Sami Ayoub (USA). The translation was edited by Mr. Abu Khaliyl (USA), Mr. Muhammad Farooq (Pakistan), Mr. Abdul Ahad (India) Mrs. Jalal Abualrub (USA), Mr. Abdul-Mun\'im (Egypt), Mr. Sidheeque M.A. Veliankode (India). Qari Muhammad Iqbal (Pakistan), Mr. Shakil Ahmad As-Salafi (India) and Hafiz Abdul-Matin (Pakistan). Layout planning and computer programming in an advanced publishing software was voluntarily carried out by Mr. Muhammad Munawar (Pakistan).</p>\r\n<p>The typesetting and correction of manuscript was done by Mr. Abdus-Samad (India), Syed Ali Haider (India) and Mr. Hassan Ajami (Egypt). Some valuable suggestions were made by Mr. AlArabi bin Razduq (UK) and Mr. Omar Johnson (USA).</p>\r\n<p>We have tried our best not to include any weak Hadith in this presentation. All the authentic sayings of the Prophet (S) have also been presented in the Arabic language along with diacritics. The only sections of the Arabic that were not translated are some discussions pertaining to Arabic words which were not pertinent to the English readers, such omissions are very few to mention. Topic headings were added throughout the Tafsir to help the readers better understand the discussion of the Verses of the Qur\'an. The language and style adopted for the translation is very plain and simple. The translation of the meanings of the Verses is from the translation of Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali and Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan published by Darussalam. The editors have made some changes in it at some places where it was necessary to comply with the Tafsir.</p>\r\n<p>I am thankful to all the workers, helpers and advisers who cooperated with us in the completion of this great project. And I am especially thankful to Shaykh Safi-ur-Rahman Al-Mubarakpuri, who is a great scholar of the time and from whom all of us at Darussalam benefit seeking his advice and valuable suggestions regarding our research projects and problems. We have tried our best to make it a faultless work, but human weakness may render any error in it. We ask the readers to forgive us for such errors and to inform us of that in order to remove it from the following editions.</p>\r\n<p>In the whole project, the errors are from our side and from Satan while all the good is from the blessings of Allah. If the people benefit from this translation in the understanding of the Qur\'an, we will consider it a great blessing and we pray to Allah for the best reward in the Hereafter.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul-Malik Mujahid</strong><br /> <em>General Manager, Darussalam Publications<br /> Riyadh, March 2000</em></p>','Tafsir Ibn Kathir is one of the Most Comprehensive Explanation of the Noble Quran.

May Allah, send peace and blessings upon him, his family and his Companions until the Day of judgment.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Indeed Allah Almighty has protected this religion and raised its status among the nations, sending to the world the final Messenger, Muhammad, and with him the final and most complete religion - as Allah Almighty says:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Allah Almighty has made the scholars inheritors of the Prophets; they explain to the people their religious duties and they enlighten them, so that their worship of Allah Almighty is based on knowledge and insight. One such scholar, whom the Muslims recently lost, is the noble Shaikh and Imam, \'Abdul-\'Aziz bin \'Abdullah bin Baz - may Allah Almighty have mercy on him, for he spent his life in knowledge, in teaching, in passing scholarly judgments and rulings. But over and above his knowledge, he was a man who was righteous and pious; he sought little from this world, and his manners were truly noble.

They have used statistics, conducted researches, arranged interviews, provided solutions, and exposed the real attitudes in this regard. They have presented the ideal and most practical way to deal with the important issues of our life: by making the mind as the authority to decide about the matters instead of our emotions. They have shown how to analyze a situation and seek the possible ways that can produce better results. In fact, this logic of resolving the issues and solving the problems can be applied to every situation to benefit from.</p>\r\n<p>In short, the book tells us to see the facts of life in their true perspective without exaggerating or minimizing them from their actual conditions - and that is the most objective method to deal with our lives and the lives of others.

There is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good (reformed) the whole body becomes good, but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt, and that is the heart. - Bukhari vol. 1 #49</p>\r\n<p>In studying the shahada, I learn often learn something new about what it encompasses. A simple example is that to believe that Mohammad [pbuh] is the last messenger indicates a belief that there were messengers before him. Or, to say there is no god but Allah means to not equate anything with Allah, and that everything, good and bad, comes from Allah. \'There is no god but Allah,\' is said so often that sometimes the gravity of the statement is lost and we forget what it means.</p>\r\n<p>This book takes an honest look at the emotional booby-traps of polygyny and the foremost danger is forgetting that there is no god but Allah. From personal experience, I know that when sisters discuss polygyny, conversations are fraught with phrases like, \'it\'s not for me,\' \'I couldn\'t live with such an arrangement,\' \'I would be so hurt.\' These ideas indicate that Allah was wrong when He made such a practice halal. That it might be fine for the wives of the Prophet [pbuh], but not for ourselves, because our happiness resides not in Allah, but in the monogamy of our husbands.</p>\r\n<p>From Monogamy to Polygyny gently considers the inevitable sadness, confusion and sense of loss that a wife feels when polygyny becomes a reality for her family. It also addresses climbing out of the darkness of hurt feelings coming out a stronger woman, with a stronger marriage and most importantly a stronger faith and dependence on Allah. A stronger woman because she will learn to appreciate herself and the abilities given her by Allah. A stronger marriage because she will better understand her purpose in being a wife and will, insha\'Allah, rely on her husband as a comfort from Allah, rather than the sole source of happiness and confidence in this life. A wife\'s concept of loving her husband, being a support to him for the sake of Allah, will have a true depth that will only benefit the marriage, keeping Allah indeed at the forefront. In fact, this book makes these points so well that it can inspire a sister to change her behaviour with regard to her husband, even if polygyny is not a factor in her marriage.</p>\r\n<p>No matter how many good books are written about it, polygyny is never a bed of roses initially and the authors take the time to study two examples of multiple marriage being introduced to wives. In the first example, a husband tells his wife of five years, Umm Leila, that he is considering marrying another wife. He has no particular woman in mind and isn\'t actively looking, but he feels it\'s something in his future. His wife feels that for him to consider polygyny, there must be something lacking in her. Her first thoughts are not that Allah has made this permissible to her husband and therefore there must be some benefit to her, but instead that she has the ability to make her husband so unhappy that he must seek satisfaction in a second woman.</p>\r\n<p>She writes:</p>\r\n<p>I thought he loved me. I thought he cared about me, that he wanted to be with me for the time we were on this earth together. Now I am not good enough. Now I feel like he wants to turn his back on me and love another woman. What did I do to him to make him do this to me? What am I going to do? I don\'t know how to make it to the next day. I am sick, I am tired. My energy is gone. I am no longer happy when I see him or hear him. Why has he done this to me?</p>\r\n<p>Umm Leila\'s struggle with the possibility of her husband taking another wife spans over a year, and ends in with a surprising result.</p>\r\n<p>In the second example, that of Umm Aishah, polygyny is introduced to her family after it\'s a done deal. Women finding out about their co-wives after the nikkah has been signed is very common. The husband\'s logic is his wife might dissuade him or ask for a divorce if he introduces his desire for another wife to her beforehand. Brothers might want to reconsider this strategy because then the argument becomes not one of multiple marriage, but trust between husband and wife. Better to give your wife this book first and then get married again, but since that doesn\'t happen often, Umm Aishah\'s example shows that even this pain can be overcome.</p>\r\n<p>This book offers practical advice in getting through the darkest times of multiple marriage, including a husband\'s wedding night, and getting along with co-wives. Co-wives living in harmony isn\'t always possible or even necessary, but the authors encourage wives with specific ideas on how to get along sincerely with their equals before deciding they will never be friends.</p>\r\n<p>I find the book lacking in two areas, the first in addressing the husband who takes on more wives than he can support. While the authors write from a stand point that anything can be overcome in polygyny, they do not offer recommendations to the sister who might feel abandoned financially or is otherwise treated unfairly in a true sense. Secondly, while the authors\' use Koran and ahadith to support a man\'s right to multiple wives, they ignore rights Allah has given specifically to women that could be referred to in balance. For instance the right of a woman to be supported entirely by her husband financially and her own money remaining for her own use.</p>\r\n<p>My reason for reading this book had nothing to do with polygyny. As a sister who is spending more time in the community, I was having trouble dealing with difficult personalities that I met. Who more at odds than co-wives, I thought, choosing this book and adapting the ideas in it to my concerns. I got a million times more from this book than I could have hoped and therefore I feel an obligation to recommend it to every sister, regardless of her family\'s position on multiple marriage. Polygyny is not on my family\'s radar at this time. Two months ago I might have written that it would never be a consideration, but this book has helped me correct my thinking and should it ever come up, as is my husband\'s right, I pray that I will handle the situation with grace and dignity given to me by Allah subhana wa ta\'ala. From Monogamy to Polygny: A Way Through offers help in organizing one\'s thinking to accept the qadr of Allah, which should be the greatest concern of each of us.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Umm Yusuf Gondekowa, Canada</strong></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:gondekowa@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">gondekowa@gmail.com</a></p>','This book addresses the deep and complex issues and concerns the Muslim women worldwide have with polygyny.','en','2013-08-05 10:56:41',1,'2013-08-05 10:56:41',1),(105,783,'Furqan Visits Fez','<p>For centuries, the beautiful Moroccan city of Fez has been the cultural jewel of all northwest Africa.

This great opportunity opened the door for him to enrich his knowledge about all aspects of Hajj from the Qur\'an and Sunnah point of view.

Our pious Predecessors have tried their utmost to live life according to them.

This can be achieved by taking the right preparatory steps in terms of seeking the right spouse, or the parent to be in accordance with Prophetic instructions. The warning of the Prophet (pbuh): \"If a suitor whose faith and conduct you are satisfied with comes to you, marry him your daughter. If you do not, there will be affliction on earth and gross corruption.\"</p>\r\n<p>One may wonder how could affliction and corruption ensue on a universal scale from an affair which involves only two people. This would be a valid question to be asked by those who look at marriage from a narrow perspective. This matrimonial union which involves a couple, constitutes the core of society. Its state of affairs is reflected on the society positively or negatively. A pious couple provides pious offspring with the Will of Allah. Were every guardian to insist on choosing a committed spouse, non-committed people would have no choice but to be good Muslims, otherwise, they would not find any family to associate with them. But unfortunately, wealth, lineage, social status and similar factors top the priority list for marriage.</p>\r\n<p>As for the affliction and corruption that are mentioned in the above Hadith; they are the direct result of marriages of non-committed Muslims who are not keen on raising children according to Islamic standards. We know that children learn more by example than by words. No one among us says I am a non-committed Muslim, yet telling our children what to do and not showing them by good example is the action of a non-committed Muslims. This is hypocritical and drives children to confusion and away from us. The result is that the number of such non-committed Muslims increases and affliction and corruption become rampant.</p>\r\n<p>It gives pious parents great pleasure to see their children a good Muslims and adhering to the Right Path even better than them. Similarly, they would be most miserable to see them corrupted and wretched. Thus, one must take great care of his children and seek all means that help him provide the society with God conscious members.

May Allah\'s peace and blessings be upon the greatest of the Prophets and Messengers - our Prophet Muhammad - and upon his Family and all of his Companions.</p>\r\n<p>One of the important factors in the development and behaviors of the societies of the world today is the impact of role models. Now, more than ever, role models are affecting the lives of all races and classes of people around the world. Because of mediums such as television, radio, telephone and the internet, many role models, such as movie stars, athletes, musicians and politicians, have become quite popular around the world.</p>\r\n<p>However, such role models do not necessarily represent the ideal style of life, practices and beliefs that are wanted for the Muslim. When Muslims look up to sinful or disbelieving people who have been portrayed in the media to be successful and famous, they began to feel inferior to them. Satan may even deceive them into feeling that the reason for the non-Muslims\' worldly success is their following of ways other than Islam.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, Darussalam has brought to life in this work the stories of some of the greatest heroes and role models of Islam. In this way we serve the cause of increasing the Muslims\' conviction to their faith. The efforts and sacrifices of these people for the sake of Allah\'s religion will show us who we are and what we really are capable of when we have strong belief in Allah.</p>\r\n<p>We thank Mr. Sidheeque M.A. Veliankode, a member of the Research Division of Darussalam for his diligent effort in publishing this work.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Heroes and Heroism</h3>\r\n<p>Every nation has its own heroes. Some are real while others are mythical. These heroes are sources of admiration, and even adoration by certain communities. In enlightened societies real heroes may be models for emulation. But who is a real hero? He is a person usually admired or respected for special qualities he is endowed with or for certain acts of bravery and chivalry.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Heroes of Islam</h3>\r\n<p>Muslims have no need to look for fictitious or mythical heroes, because their history is abundant with heroes of real flesh and blood, whose acts were heroic because of their faith, and a consequence of their attitude to life and the world. For all the heroes of Islam share two very special traits: full conviction and dedication to their pristine faith and constant attempt to seek the Pleasure of their Creator, Allah, alone, regardless of the circumstances and times they live in. For a Muslim hero, be he a military genius, a scholar teacher, or a devout common person, knows that the transient life in this world is a means to the eternal life in the Hereafter, and that ephemeral pains and pleasures are nothing compared to the everlasting pains and pleasures of Hell and Heaven. To this hero, the key to the whole thing is Divine Pleasure. Through it alone can a person enjoy peace and tranquility in this world and attain real happiness in the life hereafter.</p>\r\n<p>The Prophet (salla-Liaahu \'alayhi wa-sallam) is reported to have said: \"Strange is the case of the believer. Everything turns to his advantage only. If adversity befalls him he patiently accepts it, and is rewarded for it. If prosperity happens to him he shows gratitude to his Lord (in word and action), and is rewarded for it.\" So a hero of Islam faces both prosperity and adversity with the right attitude and action. His goal is not worldly pleasures and gains, but rather the Pleasure of Allah.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Purpose of this Book</h3>\r\n<p>In this book we will try to present glimpses of the lives of a few heroes of Islam. But they all exhibit that special quality and trait of a Muslim hero. It is my hope that the reader will find actual examples of qualities we all need to instill in ourselves and our dear ones so that Muslims may once again take their proper place and play their vital role in human civilization and history.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mahmoud Esma\'il Sieny, Ph.D.</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Professor of Applied Linguistics</em></p>','This book presents the glimpses of the lives of some of the greatest heroes and role models of Islam.','en','2013-08-05 10:56:41',1,'2013-08-05 10:56:41',1),(126,804,'History of Madinah Munawwarah','<h3>From the Back Page</h3>\r\n<p>In this book, mention has been made about the different aspects of Al-Madinah, and the most important historical events are recorded that have direct effect on the establishment and sacredness of Al-Madinah as well as its religious weight.</p>\r\n<p>This book has highlighted the sites that are highly important whenever Al-Madinah is mentioned like the Prophet\'s Mosque, Quba Mosque and others.</p>\r\n<p>A great part of the book is designated to speak about the Prophet\'s Mosque updating the expansions and the improvements that has taken place from the time of Muhammad (pbuh) till the Saudi era.</p>\r\n<p>It contains more than fifty, pictures taken from original documented resources.

And the love of the Muslims for Al Madinah is not surprising, since the Prophet (pbuh) encouraged it, saying: \"O Allah! Make Al-Madinah beloved to us, as we love Makkah -or more.\"</p>\r\n<p>And Al-Madinah is still one of the most beloved places on earth - if not the most beloved in the heart of every Muslim, in response to this fine call. And Al-Madinah was the place to which Allah\'s Messenger emigrated and it gave him refuge, embraced his preaching and supported his religion, and its people defended him with their lives, their wealth and their sons until Allah made him victorious. So, Al-Madinah possesses virtues which are well known and an influence which none disputes in supporting this religion.</p>\r\n<p>And the land of Al-Madinah contains his pure remains and its ennoblement is increased thereby and it includes his Mosque, by which its purity is increased and its station is raised by them both and it is elevated in esteem, honor and love in the hearts of the Muslims. And all of Al-Madinah is superior, for therein deeds are multiplied (in reward) and prayer therein is equivalent to a thousand prayers in any other mosque, except the Sacred Mosque (in Makkah). And at the gates of Al-Madinah are angels, so neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal can enter it. And in it there is a Garden from the Gardens of Paradise, and a believer who dies in Al-Madinah, will be included in the intercession of the Messenger on a Day when neither wealth nor sons will avail.</p>\r\n<p>And the Prophet (pbuh) declared it inviolable, just as Abraham declared Makkah inviolable. And because it is good, it removes the evil ones from within itself, just as bellows remove the impurities from iron, for verily, Allah defends them, so whoever causes them to fear through injustice, Allah will cause him to fear and Allah\'s curse will be upon him. And it has been called Tabah and likewise, Taibah and so all that is in it is Tayyib (good): its land, its air, its dates, its Mudd and its Sa\' (measures of weight), life therein and death therein. And before all of this, the Mosque of Allah\'s Messenger and his resting place.</p>\r\n<p>And from the starting-point of the high rank, elevated position and lofty standing of Al-Madinah with Allah the Most High, His Messenger (pbuh) and all of the Muslims, we present this book as a work purely and sincerely for Allah and a true expression of our love for the City of the Messenger. And the reader will find in it - Allah willing - abundant facts about the City of the Messenger in spite of its brevity.</p>\r\n<p>And we have taken care to present the most reliable narrations and the most authentic Ahadith.

This book was originally written in the Urdu language in 1922 (1343 AH) by Akbar Shah Khan Najeebabadi. This was the time about 25 years before the partition of Indian Subcontinent into Pakistan and India. For the purpose of brevity, the compiler has presented the authentic events in concise form from the famous histories of Islam written in the Arabic and Persian languages by the great Muslim historians like Tabari, Ibn Athir, Mas\'udi, Abul-Fida\', Ibn Khaldun and Suyuti, apart from getting benefited from the authentic books of Ahadith for the compilation of the part about the biography of the Prophet Muhammad. So, this compilation is actually the extract of the works of the famous Muslim historians.</p>\r\n<p>In the first volume, starting with the introduction of the history as a subject, the country, people and conditions of Arabia prior to the advent of Islam were discussed, and an account of the life of Prophet Muhammad was presented including the hardships and opposition he faced while propagating the message of Islam, and the details of migration and the period after it until his death. After that the description of Rightly Guided Caliphate was also discussed in its full perspective.</p>\r\n<p>In this second volume, starting with the Caliphate of Banu Umayyah, the martyrdom of Imam Husain (R) and the Caliphate of the Abbasids, all areas have been covered as far as the expansion of Islam was.</p>\r\n<p>This third volume begins with the description of the conditions of Spain before and after the rule of Muslims and the role played by Umayyad, Abbasid, Almoravid and Almohad Caliphs there and their encounters with the Christian Armies. Then some mention of the conquest of Morocco and North Africa has been given along with the details of Idrisia and Aghlabs rule there. After that detailed accounts of Ganghisid Mongols, Turks and Tartar Mangols have been produced. After that Islamic history of Persia is described giving the accounts of Saffariah, Samanid, Delmid, Gharnavid, Seljuk, Ghourid and Muluk Dynasties with the periods of Khwarizm Shah, Atabeks and Sistan Kings rule there. Then the Islamic history of Egypt and Syria is covered describing the Ubaidullah, Ayyubid and Mamluk Dynasties, and the rule of Atabek and Abbasid Caliphs. In the end, something about the Ottoman Dynasty and its Empire is discussed including the description of the conquest of Constantinople.</p>\r\n<p>We hope that the readers will find this volume also of great help in the study of Islamic history. The famous scholar Safi-ur-Rahman Mubarakpuri has revised the Urdu edition before its translation to check the authenticity aspect.</p>\r\n<p>The translation was done by the Translation Department of Darussalam, and every care has been taken to reproduce the events and the names of the persons and places as accurately as possible.

Thus, the more the slave increases in the actualization of At-Tauhid, the more he is likely to enter Paradise, whatever his deeds may be. For this reason the Imaam - may Allah have mercy upon him - mentioned the Verse of Surah AI-An\'am (6:82).</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote1\">[1]</a></strong> And Allah the Most High said,</p>\r\n<p>\"Those who believe and do not mix their belief with Zulm, for them there is security and they are guided ones.\" (6:82)</p>\r\n<p>The word Zulm (wrongdoing, oppression) here means Ash-Shirk. This is like what has been narrated in the Hadith of Ibn Mas\'ud that the Prophet said concerning this Verse when the Companions considered it to be something tremendous (i.e. too difficult). They said, \"O Messenger of Allah! Which of us does not wrong himself (i.e. by committing sins)?!\" The Prophet (pbuh) replied,</p>\r\n<p>\"It is not that which you think. The Zulm is As-Shirk. Don\'t you hear the statement of the righteous slave (Lugmaan), \'Verily Ash-Shirk (associating partners with Allah) is a great Zulm (wrongdoing, oppression and injustice) indeed.\"\' (31:13)</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the meaning of the Verse according to what is appropriate for this chapter is: Those who believe and do not mix their faith up with any Shirk; for them there is security and they are guided ones. Thus, the virtue of the one who believes - meaning he singles out Allah with At-Tauhid, and he does not mix his faith up with any Dhulm, meaning he does not mix his belief in At-Tauhid up with any Shirk - is that for him is complete security and guidance. Hence, the more At-Tauhid is decreased by the servant being covered with some types of Dhulm, which is Ash-Shirk, the more the security and guidance leaves him in relative proportion to that.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote2\">[2]</a></strong> He then said: \'Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (r.a) narrated that Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh) said,</p>\r\n<p>\"Whoever testifies that there is none worthy of being worshipped but Allah, Who has no partner, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger...\"</p>\r\n<p>until he said: \"Whatever his deeds may be.\"</p>\r\n<p>This means, even if he was deficient in his deeds and he had sins and acts of disobedience. This is from the bounty of At-Tauhid upon its people.</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote3\">[3]</a></strong> He then said: They (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) also recorded the Hadith of \'Itbaan:</p>\r\n<p>\"Indeed Allah has forbidden for Hell the person who says: \'There is nothing worthy of being worshipped but Allah,\' seeking thereby the Face of Allah.\"</p>\r\n<p>When a person says this statement, which is the statement of At-Tauhid, seeking the Face of Allah by it, and he comes with its conditions and its requirements, Allah favors him and gives him what He has promised him of making him forbidden for the Fire. And this is a great bounty and favor. However, whoever comes with At-Tauhid and abstained from that which contradicts it, yet he had some sins and acts of disobedience, and he died without repenting, then he is under the Will of Allah. If Allah wills, He will punish him, then - after some time - He will make the Fire forbidden for him, and if He wills, He will forgive him and make the Fire forbidden for him initially (without punishment).</p>\r\n<p><strong><a id=\"footnote4\">[4]</a></strong> Abu Sa\'eed AI-Khudree narrated that Allah\'s Messenger (pbuh) said,</p>\r\n<p>\"Moosaa (Moses) said: \'O my Lord, teach me something by which I can remember You and supplicate to You.\' Allah answered: \'Say, O Moosaa, La ilaha illallah (non has the wright to be worshipped but Allah)...\"</p>\r\n<p>This means that if it is imagined that the sins of the servant reached the weight of the seven heavens and the weight of all that they contain of slaves and angels, and the weight of the earth, the statement Lailaha illallah would outweigh that weight of sins. This is the great virtue of the statement of At-Tauhid and it is only for whoever the statement becomes strong in his heart. Therefore, he becomes sincere in it and a firm believer in it, having no doubts concerning what it implies. He believes in what it contains and he loves what it implies. Thus, its effect becomes strong in the heart and it enlightens it, and as long as it is like this, it burns (away) whatever it meets of sins.</p>','This is English translation of famous book \"Ghayatul Murid Fi Sharah Kitab-ut-Tawheed\".','en','2013-08-05 10:56:41',1,'2013-08-05 10:56:41',1),(151,829,'Islam is Your Birthright','<p>These are the vital questions that arise in the mind of a person when he looks upon the religions for a critical study.

I afterwards made an introduction to Islam as per its meaning and pillars.

It is also a fact that adherents of each belief call others to follow their leader and extol him. As for Muslim, he does not call people to follow his ideology. His religion is the religion of Allah with which He is pleased. Allah says: \"Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.\"</p>\r\n<p>He also does not call people to glorify a human being, for all human beings are equal in the Religion of Allah; nothing distinguishes one from another except piety.

This is certain.</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully, as Muslims we have the guidance on how to avoid these problems from the beginning if we follow the laws set out for us by Allah Who knows His creation.

There is no doubt that woman is an object of beauty. This beauty is a very powerful force; Allah has prescribed how this beauty must be dealt with so that it becomes a force for good and not a source of destruction. Actions are judged by intention in Islam and as such the intention of men concerning the beauty of women must be constantly guarded. The lowering of the eyes by men is a physical act, but without the intention of doing so to protect one\'s piety and obeying Allah, we have stumbled and failed.

Islam has provided the legal way for both men and women to marry each other and maintain a family by raising their children. Islam has also imposed some rights on each other in respect of husband, wife and children so that all of them should care about the others and hold strong ties which consist of love, faith and affiliation. But this very purpose is disturbed when the mingling between men and women takes place freely, and the most to suffer as a consequence are the women and children, and they feel deserted. Therefore, it is in the interest of women that they should care about the occasions when such thing could arise.</p>\r\n<p>The same prohibition implies that men should also restrain themselves because it is also in their interest to refrain from such mingling which can disturb them mentally and physically later on.

To assist in keeping this lamp lit, it has long been our desire - by the grace of Allah - to translate some of the books written in the Arabic language which are beneficial to every person, bringing common or particular benefits, and translate these useful books into the English language.</p>\r\n<p>Minhaj Al-Muslim, or \"The Way of a Muslim\" is one of these important books whose author is the great scholar Abu Bakr Jabir Al-Jaza\'ri. The author has held the prestige of being a regular lecturer at the Prophet\'s Mosque in Al-Madinah. I had the chance to attend some of his lecturers, his way of teaching is very simple and his lectures find a place in the minds and hearts of the people.</p>\r\n<p>The great author has a very humble and pious personality. If Allah wants someone to have the honor of serving His religion, then He Himself provides him with the necessary requirements. The author was born in \'Liwah\', Al-Jaza\'ir (Algeria) in 1921 CE. He was less than one year old when his father died, his pious mother nurtured the eminent child on the basis of Islamic guidelines. He learned the whole Qur\'an in his youth before he was even twelve years old. He finished his early education in his hometown, then moved to the capital of Al-Jaza\'ir and worked there as a teacher in a school. During that period he attended the lecturers of \'Allamah At-Tayyab Abu Qir and was enlightened with the light of belief in Tawhid and the Sunnah (way) of Prophet (pbuh). When the French colonization began in 1372 AH or 1952 CE, he migrated to Al-Madinah, the city of Prophet (pbuh). King Sa\'ud bin \'Abdul-\'Aziz was the ruler at that time and Al-Madinah University was being established. Abu Bakr Jabir Al-Jaza\'ri first worked as a teacher in Al-Madinah, then he joined Al-Madinah University and worked there until his retirement. He also worked as an adviser and helper in some institutes affiliated with the Muslim World League during that time.</p>\r\n<p>Allah has given the author a great ability in reading and writing so he wrote several books, some small and some larger, totaling about eighty. Besides these he also wrote more than ten large books, among which Minhaj Al-Muslim or \"The Way of a Muslim\", \'Ageedah Mu\'min or \"The Believer\'s Creed\", and a selection on the Sirah (biography) of the Prophet (pbuh) entitled Hadha Al-Habib (This is the Beloved) and his Tafsir of the Qur\'an entitled Aysar AtTafasir are the more popular.</p>\r\n<p>The author wrote this book, Minhaj Al-Muslim, at the request of the people of Wahdah\', a city in Morocco. They desired such a book that included all of the necessary topics like correct belief, etiquette, manners, worship, business and transactions etc. So the author compiled this book after the incessant struggle of about two years, may Allah reward him and increase his benefit to the True Religion.</p>\r\n<p>We have prepared this work in two volumes in the English language due to the large amount of material that the book covers. We hope Allah will reward all of us for the benefit it may provide for the readers.</p>\r\n<p>Lastly, should any reader notice some error in our presentation of this text, we ask that they should be so kind as to inform us of that so it may be corrected in future editions.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Abdul Malik Mujahid</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>Director, Darussalaam , Riyadh, Saudi Arabia</em></p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h3>Author\'s Introduction</h3>\r\n<p>Praise is to Allah, Lord of all that exists and the God of those who passed away and those to come. Prayers, peace and blessings be upon the elite of His creation, the last of His Prophets. and Messengers, our master Muhammad, his pure family, and his Companions. May Allah the Almighty show mercy at those who followed them till the Day of Judgement. To proceed:</p>\r\n<p>There was a request made of me from some righteous brothers in the city of Wujdah during my visits to the Islamic lands of Al-Maghrib. These visits were for the purpose of inviting people to adhere to the Book of Allah the Almighty and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah since they are the only way for salvation and the source of strength and welfare for the people. The brothers asked me to compose a book for the righteous believing youth there as well as the Muslims in the general area, to serve as a law or a statute for them. It should comprise all that concerns the righteous Muslim regarding his creed, manners, providing direction for righteous character and acts of worship, and dealings with his colleagues. This book should be based on the light of the Book of Allah the Almighty and the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>I responded to the righteous brothers\' request, seeking help from Allah to compose the requested Minhaj. From the first day of my return to the Holy Land (Makkah and Al-Madinah), I started composing, revising and correcting it. Despite my limited spare time and the great responsibilities I bear, Allah the Almighty has blessed the few hours I managed to steal (save) from my days pocket filled with concerns and preoccupation. Only two years had passed since my start and the book was composed exactly as I hoped and as the brothers requested.</p>\r\n<p>Here is the book that I submit to the righteous of the Muslim brothers in every place. Were I not its author, I would describe it in a way that heightens its value and increases its demand and acceptance to the readers. But it is sufficient for me to say that it is a book which no Muslim house should be without.</p>\r\n<p>As for the topics related to Fiqh, the acts of worship, and other dealings, I spared no effort in investigating and searching for the most sound opinion of the eminent scholars such as Imams Abu Hanifah, Malik, Ash Shafl\'i, and Ahmad, may Allah have mercy on them all, when there was no conclusive text or apparent proof from the Book of Allah the Almighty and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh) for a topic.</p>\r\n<p>For this reason, I have not the least doubt that he who behaves in accordance with the rulings of this Minhaj either in the subjects of creed, Fiqh, manners, or character, actually behaves in accordance with the Shari\'ah of Allah the Almighty and with the guidance of His Messenger (pbuh).</p>\r\n<p>Whenever I chose the opinion of a particular Imam on a matter of Fiqh, I spared no effort in checking the various and numerous sources, and weighing the different opinions of the well known scholars.</p>\r\n<p>Out of my hope that the righteous Muslim brothers should have one way in which their efforts could be unified, their motivation, and their response be united, I was compelled to take such a difficult task under which I bore heavy burdens, and praise is to Allah the Almighty Who enabled and helped me to achieve that goal.</p>\r\n<p>I complain to Allah the Almighty, my Lord, about every person who may say that I have innovated an innovation in this work or I have introduced a tenet contradicting the Muslims.</p>\r\n<p>I pray unto Him against anyone who tries to detract the righteous of this nation from the way or from that Minhaj to which I have invited the people, because I am well aware that I have not deviated, intentionally or unintentionally, even a hair from the Book of Allah the Almighty, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (pbuh), nor from the sound opinions of the Imams of Islam and the millions of the Muslims who followed them.</p>\r\n<p>I have no objective except that the Muslims be gathered via the shortest route, after their separation and dissipation.</p>\r\n<p>O Allah!

All these aspects have been dealt with in this book, which seeks to clarify the misconceptions. This incident, which happened during the time of Muhammad (SAWS), demonstrates a clear sign of his Prophethood. This book not only gives an account of the splitting of the moon in an interesting manner, but also touches upon other miracles connected with the moon split. The author has shown great skill in clarifying doubts and suspicions that arise among the modern students. He also tries to erase their doubts through various aspects of the story in the light of the Noble Qur\'an and the Sunnah.\"</p>','Author tries to erase their doubts through various aspects of the

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\" href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 10th Anniversary Tees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:40:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"Store\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"swag\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"wp10\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2561\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:334:\"In honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary celebrations, we&#8217;ve put a special 10th anniversary tshirt in the swag store at cost &#8212; $10 per shirt plus shipping.

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave: </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking: </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus: </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers: </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes.

The WordPress community is stronger than ever, and some of the accomplishments of the past year are definitely worth remembering.</p>\n<h4>Software Releases</h4>\n<p>We had two major releases of the WordPress web application with versions <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/green/\">3.4</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/12/elvin/\">3.5</a>, as well as 5 security releases during 2012. 3.4 included the theme customizer, while 3.5 became the long awaited &#8220;media release&#8221; featuring a new uploader and gallery management tool. 3.5 contained code contributions from more people than ever, and we hope to continue growing the contributor ranks in the year ahead. We currently have native apps on 6 mobile platforms &#8212; <a href=\"http://ios.wordpress.org/\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"http://android.wordpress.org/\">Android</a>, <a href=\"http://blackberry.wordpress.org/\">Blackberry</a>, <a href=\"http://wpwindowsphone.wordpress.com/\">Windows Phone</a>, <a href=\"http://nokia.wordpress.org/\">Nokia</a>, and <a href=\"http://webos.wordpress.org/\">WebOS</a> &#8212; and saw several updates there as well.</p>\n<h4>Plugin Directory</h4>\n<p>A number of improvements were made to the Plugin Directory in 2012. More cosmetic  updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/\">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/support/\">forum support</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/\">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit\">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href=\"http://sopastrike.com/numbers/\">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.5\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore</a> and <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5\">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

been very gratifying to see people continuing to discover <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/\">Capsule</a> this week, and seeing it resonate with them. This was typed into the demo earlier today:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\n  This software is an example of a thing that everyone wants but doesn&#8217;t exist until a great idea suddenly comes and voila! it appears!\n</p></blockquote>\n<p>There are a couple of new features committed to GitHub that you can play with if you like.</p>\n<h2>Hotkeys</h2>\n<p>In the <code>feature/hotkeys</code> branch<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> in the <code>ui</code> submodule, you&#8217;ll find some additional keyboard shortcuts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>shift+h = navigate to home</li>\n<li>shift+n = new entry</li>\n<li>shift+f = set focus to search field</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Make sure to update submodules as the <a href=\"https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys\">jQuery Hotkeys library</a> has been added.</p>\n<h2>Capsule Server Queue</h2>\n<p>In the <code>feature/queue</code> branch you&#8217;ll find an implementation of a very basic &#8220;send at least once&#8221; queue so that pushing posts to Capsule Server is no longer a blocking action (it makes saves faster). Another benefit to this feature is better support for using Capsule while offline. Saved entries are stored in the queue and sent to Capsule Server once Capsule is online again. To test this out, you&#8217;ll need to update your Capsule Server to the latest code in the <code>develop</code> branch.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-capsule/issues?page=1&state=closed\">fixed a few bugs and incorporated a few submitted enhancements</a>. Thanks to everyone who has contributed.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\nWe use the excellent <a href=\"https://github.com/nvie/gitflow\">Git Flow model</a> at <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a>. Features are implemented in <code>feature</code> branches before being merged back to <code>develop</code> and subsequently into a release.&#160;<a

class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"10 Years of WordPress\" /></div><p>The official 10th anniversary of the release of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> is May 27, 2013. It has been an amazing 10 years, during which WordPress evolved from a simple blogware to a very full-featured CMS (Content Management System), used to power some of the biggest and most popular web sites on the internet. All over the world, people are <a title=\"Party on, Wayne!\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/save-the-date-may-27/\">planning celebrations</a>. As much as I like a good party, I thought this would also be a good time to celebrate WordPress by actually using WordPress &#8212; for blogging.</p>\n<p>So much of our content sharing these days tends to be via centralized &#8220;social&#8221; platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, etc., that some of us neglect our blogs. I know <em>I&#8217;m</em> guilty of that. But this anniversary is a good excuse for the WordPress community to take a few minutes to consider their time with our favorite website building tool. Here&#8217;s what I propose&#8230;</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-64213\"></span><br />\nThink about the past 10 years, and your time with WordPress. Maybe, like myself, you&#8217;ve been using WordPress since the beginning, or perhaps you just tried it out for the first time last month. But consider the events that stand out in your memory during that time. Now, write a blog post about it. Wherever you fall on the timeline, you should probably be able to write something about one or more of the following openings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;When WordPress was first released in 2003..&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;When I first started using WordPress&#8230;&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;Since I first started using WordPress&#8230;&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, for example, I&#8217;ve been using WordPress pretty much since the beginning. I didn&#8217;t actually switch my blog until September 2003, but I&#8217;d been committing to core before that, so I might list things like,</p>\n<p>When WordPress was released in May 2003:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I was 36 years old</li>\n<li>I had been married for less than 2 years</li>\n<li>I already had nearly 10 years of web development experience</li>\n<li>My Pentium 4 laptop with 1GB of RAM was a screaming machine</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I first started using WordPress in September 2003&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Ellen Degeneres show had just debuted on TV</li>\n<li>The US Treasury redesigned the $20 bill</li>\n<li>George W.

It creates static pages that are served quickly by the web server. Sometimes however, users still want parts of their pages to remain dynamic and be non static. That&#8217;s where <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-super-cache/faq/\">mfunc, mclude and dynamic-cached-content</a> came in.</p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p>Unfortunately it was reported recently that remote visitors to sites using the plugin could execute any code they like by simply leaving a comment containing the right mfunc code. These functions are now disabled by default, and a filter removes harmful code from comments but if enabled they pose a security risk. I considered adding a security code to the mfunc tag but unfortunately the best way of dealing with this problem is to replace it completely with something different. The next release of the plugin will do away with mfunc, mclude and dynamic-cached-content entirely. </p>\n<p><strong>The new dynamic cache system</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/the-development-version-of-wp-super-cache/\">development version of WP Super Cache</a> has already been updated with a new filter based system. It uses a cacheaction filter called &#8220;wpsc_cachedata&#8221;. This filter runs when a page is first cached and also when a cached page is subsequently served. It also runs when caching is disabled for known users, something that has always been broken when using mfunc.</p>\n<p>Almost all the data that is displayed on your website will run through the cacheaction filter &#8220;wpsc_cachedata&#8221;. When a page is first cached, the data that is shown to the first visitor of that page goes through that filter. The second visitor gets a cached page and that page too goes through the filter. What this allows us to do is define a template tag (or more than one) that a function hooked on that filter can search for in the filtered data. It can replace that tag with some other text, usually derived from code that has to run on each request. The visitor is then shown the page with the replaced tag.</p>\n<p><strong>Example code</strong></p>\n<p>The readme.txt hasn&#8217;t been updated yet but an example plugin, <a href=\"http://svn.wp-plugins.org/wp-super-cache/trunk/plugins/dynamic-cache-test.php\">dynamic-cache-test.php</a> is included in WP Super Cache. It&#8217;s fairly simple but it&#8217;s documented so it should be easy enough to follow. A template tag is inserted at the bottom of the page using the wp_footer action, and a filter then replaces that tag with text and the current server time. That test plugin replaces mfunc code that would look like this, excluding the necessary code to hook on to wp_footer and print it.</p>\n<p><code>&lt;!--mfunc echo \"&lt;!-- Hello world at \" . date( \'H:i:s\' ) . \" -->\"; --><br />\n&lt;?php echo \"&lt;!-- Hello world at \" . date( \'H:i:s\' ) . \" -->\" ?><br />\n&lt;!--/mfunc--></code></p>\n<p>WP Super Cache has it&#8217;s own action hooks using add_cacheaction() and do_cacheaction(), and work like WordPress actions or filters. The reason the plugin needs those is because they are available <em>before</em> WordPress is loaded. They allow developers to hook into the plugin from the very start of the PHP process and modify how it works using plugins. Those plugins are usually copied into wp-super-cache/plugins/ but I encourage you to move that directory elsewhere because when WordPress updates the plugin it will delete any custom changes you make. The next time a new version of WP Super Cache comes out WordPress will delete the wp-super-cache folder, replacing it with the new update. In your wp-config.php set <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> to the location of the new plugins directory.</p>\n<p>If you use this filter system in your own plugin for distribution do not <em>ever</em> define the template tag for the user. Let the user decide what it is or generate a random tag and save it somewhere. It&#8217;s important to keep the tag secret so visitors cannot trigger your function maliciously. It is however better than the remote user running any code they like as was the case with mfunc!</p>\n<p>I hope to release a new version with this code late next week. If your plugin or site uses mfunc please download the <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/the-development-version-of-wp-super-cache/\">development version</a> on a test server and start the process of updating your code.<br />\nOn the other hand, if you don&#8217;t want to update your mfunc tags you could try <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/\">W3 Total Cache</a> instead. It uses the mfunc tag with a secret code.</p>\n<div align=\"center\"><!--\n				google_ad_client = \"pub-1076796686536503\";\n			/* 336x280, created 22/05/09 */\n			google_ad_slot = \"6456264552\";\n			google_ad_width = 336;\n			google_ad_height = 280;\n			//-->\n				</div>\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/04/24/wp-super-cache-1-3-2/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 1.3.2\">WP Super Cache 1.3.2</a></li><li> <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li></ul></p><p><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/05/01/mfunc-in-wp-super-cache-1-4-and-beyond/\">mfunc in WP Super Cache 1.4 and beyond</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie\">Holy Shmoly!</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 01 May 2013 15:23:06 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.7.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://buddypress.org/?p=163045\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"http://buddypress.org/2013/04/buddypress-1-7-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:899:\"<p>BuddyPress 1.7.1 is now available.

caching is useful for caching HTML snippets that are expensive to generate and exist in multiple places on your site.

I optimized it around ease of implementation. I wanted, as much as possible, to be able to identify a slow HTML-outputting block of code, and just wrap this code around it without having to refactor anything about the code inside.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Implementation is pretty easy, and you can reference the comment at the start of the code for that. The only thing to consider is that any variables that alter the output need to be build into the key.

I&#8217;m thrilled.</p>\n<p>As Capsule is a product in a nascent category, my biggest concern was that people wouldn&#8217;t immediately see the benefits it could provide. That clearly has not been the case. Capsule appears to be a solution to a problem people (at least subconsciously) knew they had; and they appear ready to embrace it.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also been wonderful to see a few feature requests, bug reports and pull requests on GitHub already. Capsule is aimed at a developer audience, and it&#8217;s wonderful to see the community already pitching in.</p>\n<h2>Capsule Permissions</h2>\n<p>WordPress has a capability in it&#8217;s permissions matrix called <code>unfiltered_html</code>. You need to have this capability in order for certain things (like <code>&lt;?php ... ?&gt;</code>) not to be stripped from your content on save. On our demo site, this capability is quite obviously not available to the demo user.</p>\n<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be an issue in most real-life situations as Capsule is designed to be a single-user journal and it&#8217;s reasonable to expect that the single user account is an admin account (which does have the <code>unfiltered_html</code> capability).</p>\n<p>Where this has appeared to be problematic is on WordPress multi-site installs. It&#8217;s been reported to me that only the site-admin role has this by default. I haven&#8217;t dug in to confirm this, but I&#8217;d guess that&#8217;s accurate. I think it&#8217;s likely that <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/user-role-editor/\">existing</a> <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced/\">plugins</a> solve this and Capsule probably shouldn&#8217;t do anything to muck around with WordPress capabilities and permissions, but I&#8217;m open to creative ideas. Here&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-capsule/issues/15\">GitHub issue</a> if you&#8217;d like to chime in.</p>\n<h2>My Capsule Usage</h2>\n<p>I use Capsule as a <a href=\"http://fluidapp.com/\">Fluid app</a>, allowing me to invoke it easily from <a href=\"http://obdev.at/launchbar/\">Launchbar</a> and keep it out of my mess of browser tabs.</p>\n<p>I have Capsule installed locally rather than on a remote web server. I find myself working without internet from time to time (coffee shops, airplanes, etc.) and don&#8217;t want to be without access to my notes. I have a CRON job that backs up my Capsule database hourly to Dropbox.</p>\n<p>A number of people immediately thought of Capsule as a code snippet library. It may well be suitable for this, but that&#8217;s not how I use it. I do put code in it, but more of my entries are notes on implementation and architecture approaches (especially rejected approaches).</p>\n<p>I primarily work on a laptop with an external monitor. I keep Capsule on my laptop screen while I have my code and browser on my big monitor.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Thinking, planning and notes happen on the secondary screen while main dev happens on the big screen.</p>\n<p>Thinking and coding are two different acts.

contributions in areas like core code, documentation, answering questions in the support forums, translation, and all the other things it takes to make WordPress the best publishing platform it can be, with the most supportive community. This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span>We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=\"http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 25 Apr 2013 03:18:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Jen Mylo\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"Donncha: WP Super Cache 1.3.2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"http://ocaoimh.ie/?p=89498321\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/04/24/wp-super-cache-1-3-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3767:\"<p><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/y/58\">WP Super Cache</a> is a full page caching plugin for WordPress that will speed up your website.</p>\n<p>This is a security release and any users of the plugin should update as soon as possible. This release and the last 2 (1.3 and 1.3.1) address the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> A visitor to a website using WP Super Cache can remotely execute code by way of a specially crafted comment left on the blog. The comment may even be moderated and it will still cause a problem. If you allow untrusted user content on your site through other means it should also be filtered in a similar way. See the function <code>no_mfunc_in_comments</code> for the existing filter. This will be mitigated in the next release by using a security keyword in the mfunc/mclude/dynamic-cached-content tag.</li>\n<li> An XSS vulnerability was found in the plugins settings page of the plugin. This has been fixed as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The dynamic cached content features are now disabled by default as they should really have been a long time ago. This was announced in the Upgrade Notice of the previous release so hopefully site owners will be prepared for it. If you depend on this feature you can enable it again on the Advanced Settings page. I would encourage you to use Javascript instead for any dynamic features or use a short cache expiration time.</p>\n<p>Support for the <a href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/mobile-theme/\">mobile theme in Jetpack</a> has been added in this release by way of a helper plugin. If you enable this feature in Jetpack you should visit the Plugins tab of WP Super Cache and enable the Jetpack plugin there. Caching will be changed to PHP mode, and mobile device support enabled but you may have to manually remove the WP Super Cache mod_rewrite rules in the .htaccess at the root of your site. </p>\n<p>I would like to thank WordPress.org user <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/pwn3d?replies=19\">kisscsaby</a> for finding the mfunc problem in WP Super Cache and W3 Total Cache and <a href=\"http://blog.futtta.be/2013/04/18/wp-caching-plugin-vulnerability-debrief/\">Frank Goossens</a> for his help fixing it.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I should have stated this above. I did not know about the issue with mfunc until 3 weeks after kisscsaby posted it to a public forum. I don&#8217;t read every post on the support forum unfortunately and the user <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/topic/pwn3d?replies=19#post-4078203\">did not email me</a>. I released version 1.3 within a day of hearing about the problem. Unfortunately the XSS vulnerability became known 24 hours after that requiring another release within 36 hours of the previous one. When it became clear that mfunc could be exploited still I released version 1.3.2</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m leaning towards removing the mfunc/mclude/dynamic-cached-content feature completely. It&#8217;s only used by a tiny minority of users (who will be inconvenienced, sorry) but it&#8217;s dangerous code to have in the plugin. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2009/01/09/wp-super-cache-087/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.7\">WP Super Cache 0.8.7</a></li><li> <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9\">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li></ul></p><p><a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie/2013/04/24/wp-super-cache-1-3-2/\">WP Super Cache 1.3.2</a> originally appeared on <a href=\"http://ocaoimh.ie\">Holy Shmoly!</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 21:35:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"Alex King: Capsule, The Developer’s Code Journal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://alexking.org/?p=16534\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2013/04/24/capsule-the-developers-code-journal\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7127:\"<p>I&#8217;m very pleased today to announce the release of <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/\">Capsule</a>, the developer&#8217;s code journal.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/capsule-510x185.jpg\" alt=\"Capsule\" width=\"480\" height=\"174\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium-img wp-image-16575\" /></p>\n<p>Capsule replaces the scratch document you have open when you&#8217;re coding.

Jot down TODOs, notes, decisions, things learned, as I go.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Gordon Brander (@gordonbrander) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gordonbrander/status/189397714184835073\">April 9, 2012</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>The idea of a code journal resonated with me immediately. I&#8217;ve been blogging for more than ten years here, and the act of journaling &#8211; of writing things down &#8211; definitely helps with introspection and to cement important lessons.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a> we believe in the craftsman approach to web development. We believe in constantly learning and sharing knowledge. The idea of a code journal seemed like an obvious and useful tool.</p>\n<p>Gordon talked about using text files, but I wasn&#8217;t sold on that implementation. I wanted a system that had the simplicity of using text files, but I also wanted to be able to add some structured data to make it easier to find my notes again later.</p>\n<p>I like thinking about how systems and apps can work and fit together. The more I thought about the idea of a code journal, the more I realized that the information I would be recording about what I was building would be useful information to share with my colleagues. Likewise, what they recorded during their development would be interesting and useful for me and other team members. And it just so happens that my team and I are pretty handy with this little Open Source system that&#8217;s designed for journaling&#8230;</p>\n<p>We brainstormed about how we&#8217;d want to use the system and firmed up a feature set. These included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>must be incredibly low friction (it will be competing with using text files)</li>\n<li>no titles for entries (titles are friction)</li>\n<li>a good code (text) editor (after all, this is a developer code journal)</li>\n<li>ability to designate an entry as being part of a specific project</li>\n<li>ability to add tags (keywords) to entries</li>\n<li>ability to keep some entries private, but share appropriate entries with the rest of the team</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a daily user of Capsule, I&#8217;m proud to say we&#8217;ve accomplished this goal and I&#8217;m very pleased with the smoothness of the user experience.</p>\n<p>While we are releasing version 1.0 today, we&#8217;ve had a functional version Capsule on our <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdfavorite\">GitHub</a> since early May of last year and I&#8217;ve been using it while we&#8217;ve been building it. As we&#8217;ve been implementing features, we&#8217;ve also tweaked the design and implementation based on our actual usage. It&#8217;s always handy to be your own use case.</p>\n<h2>Capsule Server: Use Capsule With Your Team</h2>\n<p>We&#8217;re actually releasing two products today, Capsule and <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/capsule/#server\">Capsule Server</a>. Capsule is the code journal that each developer can set up for themselves. Capsule Server is a collaboration hub that can accept Capsule entries and make them available to other team members.</p>\n<p>I really like the way Capsule and Capsule Server interact. Developers can connect their Capsule install to as many Capsule Servers as they like. They can choose which entries get shared to which Capsule Servers, and which entries stay private &#8211; all of this with the same no-friction approach that makes it so easy to include useful metadata in Capsule entries.</p>\n<p>When you set up a Capsule Server, you define the projects for that Server. When you connect to a Capsule Server, you can chose how to map your local projects to the Capsule Server&#8217;s projects. Any entries for projects that are mapped to a Capsule Server are replicated to that Capsule Server whenever they are saved.</p>\n<p>Imagine that WordPress set up a Capsule Server for core development. Perhaps another for plugin development. I could connect to both of those, plus the Crowd Favorite Capsule Server. I would still be journaling in one place, with one tool, but I&#8217;d be sharing my notes with all the various folks I want to collaborate with.</p>\n<p>I think Capsule an excellent solution to a problem many of us don&#8217;t even know we have. I hope that it will become a valuable tool for you and your development team.</p>\n<p>Enjoy!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 18:26:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Alex\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"WordPress.tv: Reid Peifer: The Art of Quality\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=18799\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/04/24/reid-peifer-the-art-of-quality/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:646:\"<div id=\"v-VnTA5jyA-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/18799/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/18799/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=18799&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/04/24/reid-peifer-the-art-of-quality/\"><img alt=\"Reid Peifer: The Art of Quality\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/VnTA5jyA/video-b2cb4e654f_scruberthumbnail_0.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Apr 2013 15:56:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"Ping-O-Matic: Beyond Ping-O-Matic: Share &amp; Get Social with Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"http://blog.pingomatic.com/?p=85\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"http://blog.pingomatic.com/2013/04/23/plugins/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3505:\"<p>If you use <a href=\"http://pingomatic.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ping-O-Matic</a>, you&#8217;re interested in sharing your stuff with the rest of the world and driving as much traffic to your site as possible.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ve pinged search engines, but what else can you do?

From Wakemate to the Nike Fuelband I&#8217;ve tried pretty much every device that&#8217;s come on the market to help you become more self-aware of your activities, and hopefully improve them as well.</p>\n<p>Lately I&#8217;ve settled on two that I think are really high quality: the <a href=\"https://jawbone.com/up\">Jawbone UP</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.mybasis.com/\">Basis watch</a>. I would recommend either above the Nike Fuelband or Fitbit, but let me share some brief thoughts about my experiences with each:</p>\n<p>The UP is beautiful &#8212; it&#8217;s easy to wear with pretty much any outfit, even with formal wear I find I can move it up my arm a little bit inside my sleeve above my shirt cuff thanks to the flexible nature of the band. The social app they have for it is cool, though it can be a little weird to see your teammate&#8217;s minute-by-minute sleeping habits (&#8220;Hey! I noticed you were up between 3:32 and 3:50 AM last night. How &#8217;bout them Giants?&#8221;).</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_42350\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/s.ma.tt/files/2013/04/IMG_6138.png\"><img class=\" wp-image-42350  \" alt=\"I\'m very proud of my sleep.\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/s.ma.tt/files/2013/04/IMG_6138.png?resize=150%2C266\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I&#8217;m very proud of my sleep.</p></div>\n<p>The battery life is over a week so you never have to think about it, but you do have to carry around a proprietary connector for it which I keep losing leaving me (like right now) with an uncharged and useless device. To sync you plug the band into your phone&#8217;s headphone port and the sync takes a few seconds, it&#8217;s a fun process I do usually first thing in the morning to see how I slept the night before and it&#8217;s also fun to demo to friends. The first one I had was in their &#8220;mint green&#8221; color and I ended up wearing it out &#8212; it started to look dirty and I broke it where the headphone jack comes out making it difficult to charge and sync. That said, I was pretty rough on it. My new one is blue and I like it much better. My only big complaint about how the whole thing works is it doesn&#8217;t detect when you go to sleep, you have to press and hold the button on the end to put it from wake to sleep mode, which I would frequently forget to do. I really like the idea of the smart alarm and power nap features even though I never used them.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-42348\" alt=\"Basis B1 Band\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/s.ma.tt/files/2013/04/b1-basis-band.jpg?resize=195%2C139\" />The Basis is a bit clunky and retro looking, but functionality-wise it provides <a href=\"http://www.mybasis.com/basis-healthy-habits-technology/\">some really cool data</a>: it tracks your heart rate, skin temperature, perspiration level, steps, and sleep. It detects automatically when you&#8217;re asleep, no buttons to push. The data is presented in a really cool web app that lets you compare some of the data points and that I learned cool things from, like my heart rate jumps about 20 beats per minute when I wake up, and I&#8217;m most warm about two thirds into my sleep cycle. There don&#8217;t appear any social features that I&#8217;ve seen in the software, though its habit formation tracking seems pretty slick. The way the &#8220;buttons&#8221; work on the device is pretty cool, the silver dots in the corners are touch-sensitive. There&#8217;s a button on the side that I haven&#8217;t figured out what it does yet. Syncing and charging is much worse than the UP &#8212; it&#8217;s got an even clunkier proprietary USB thing that both syncs to your computer and charges, but because the display can show you how you&#8217;re doing as you go throughout the day I don&#8217;t feel the need to synchronize it as often. The heart rate tracking is by far my favorite feature. It&#8217;s comfortable to wear, but doesn&#8217;t disappear like the UP. Finally, as an added bonus, it tells the time. (Surprising useful.) If it somehow merged with <a href=\"http://getpebble.com/\">the Pebble</a> I&#8217;d be in geek heaven.</p>\n<p>If I had to pick between the two I&#8217;d just use the Basis. The awkwardness of the device is outweighed by the richness of the data it provides. For right now I&#8217;m not choosing: I wear one on each wrist and compare the data. (It&#8217;s always within a few % of each other for things they both do.) If I were hiking in the woods for a week I&#8217;d probably just take the UP as its battery would last the entire time. It&#8217;s really illustrated for me what a silo each of these systems are, they don&#8217;t talk to each other at all and it appears unlikely they ever will.</p>\n<p>Long-term I think we really need an open source package you can run on your own servers that can ingest the data from all of these services, say from back when I used to use a <a href=\"http://wakemate.com/\">Wakemate</a> sleep tracking to today&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.fitbit.com/aria\">Fitbit Aria</a> scale, the meals I track in the UP app with my Basis heart rate data and <a href=\"http://runkeeper.com/\">Runkeeper</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hundredpushups.com/\">Hundred Pushup</a> logs, and provide you with a single data store for all the personal analytics you generate across various services. I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of competition in this space in the next few years.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 22 Apr 2013 17:05:28

Let&#8217;s dive in to what&#8217;s new!</p>\n<h3>Action Bar</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-action-bar-on-nexus-7.jpg\"><img src=\"http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-action-bar-on-nexus-7.jpg?w=620&h=295\" alt=\"Version 2.3 of WordPress for Android: action bar on a Nexus 7\" width=\"620\" height=\"295\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-819\" /></a><br />\nYou&#8217;ll notice a fresh, new look. We&#8217;ve taken into account Android&#8217;s &#8220;Holo&#8221; style guidelines and implemented the Action Bar interface throughout the app. If you&#8217;ve used any other apps designed for Android 4.0 or higher, you&#8217;ll feel right at home with the new user interface. Your Action Bar provides easy access to common actions such as creating a new post, refreshing, and sharing to other apps.</p>\n<p>We also couldn&#8217;t resist making the Action Bar in WordPress blue. <img src=\"http://s1.wp.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\" alt=\";)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<h3>Menu Drawer</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-menu-drawer-on-samsung-galaxy-s3-update.jpg\"><img src=\"http://wpandroid.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/wordpress-for-android-version-2-3-menu-drawer-on-samsung-galaxy-s3-update.jpg?w=242&h=491\" alt=\"Version 2.3 of WordPress for Android: menu drawer on Samsung Galaxy S3\" width=\"242\" height=\"491\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-822\" /></a></p>\n<p>The older-style <a href=\"http://android.wordpress.org/2011/12/19/version-2-0-android-blogging-re-imagined/\">dashboard</a> user interface has been replaced with a Menu Drawer for quick and easy navigation to other areas of the app from wherever you are. You&#8217;ll find all of the same actions the dashboard had, but with the addition of some nifty new ones.</p>\n<p>To access the menu, simply tap the arrow next to the WordPress logo &#8211; in the top-left corner of the app &#8212; or swipe from the left side of the screen. If you&#8217;re on a large tablet device, the menu will always be visible, which takes advantage of the extra screen space. If you have multiple blogs in the app, you&#8217;ll see a drop-down list at the top of your Menu Drawer that you can access to quickly switch to another blog to work with, right in the app.</p>\n<p>When you leave the app, it will remember the last selection you made in the Menu Drawer so when you return, you can pick up where you left off.</p>\n<h3>Other new features</h3>\n<p>In addition to the revamped user interface, you&#8217;ll find these new features as well:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><strong>View Site option</strong>. A <em>View Site</em> option has been added to the Menu Drawer so you can view your blogs from within the app.</span></li>\n<li><strong>Admin area access.</strong> You can access the wp-admin areas of your WordPress.com blogs by loading the <em>Dashboard</em> option in the Menu Drawer.</li>\n<li><strong>Faster loading.</strong> The WordPress.com Reader now takes advantage of caching for faster loading.</li>\n<li><strong>Updated look and feel.</strong> Settings have been converted to use the Android standard for preferences, giving them the Holo look and feel on supported devices. Many views have been updated to the Holo look and feel as well, including the post editor and all list views.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved post editor experience.</strong> The post editor now has an expandable content area, which makes it much easier to navigate around the post content when you&#8217;re editing.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved image uploading.</strong> If a post has an image but fails to upload the image, the post will be saved as a draft first &#8212; instead of published &#8212; so the image upload can be corrected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Thanks &#8212; and what&#8217;s next</h3>\n<p>We thank the developers who worked so hard on this release &#8211; <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/mrroundhill\">mrroundhill</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/willnorris\">willnorris</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/isaackeyet\">isaackeyet</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/daniloercoli\">daniloercoli</a> and <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/profile/aerych\">aerych</a> &#8211; as well as the beta testers who tried out the app over at the <a href=\"http://dev.android.wordpress.org\">Developer Blog</a>. Great work, all!</p>\n<p>We also thank <a href=\"http://jakewharton.com/\">Jake Wharton</a> and <a href=\"http://simonvt.net/\">Simon Vig Therkildsen</a> for creating the ActionBarSherlock and android-menudrawer libraries that enabled us to use the Action Bar and Menu Drawer on older Android devices. Good stuff!</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s next? We&#8217;re looking at adding notifications to the app so you can keep up with what&#8217;s happening on your WordPress sites while mobile and on the go.</p>\n<p>What would you like to see added to the app?</p>\n<h3>Want to contribute?</h3>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that WordPress for Android is an open source project.

I was afraid the accounts had been compromised and the passwords changed. I had secure passwords, but had been lazy about turning on 2-factor authentication for several of them &#8211; that&#8217;s all fixed now.</p>\n<p>As it turned out, the hiccup ended up being due to a Gmail disruption.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also turned on 2-factor authentication for this site using <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-authenticator/\">this plugin</a> (make sure to enable the app key if you use iOS or Android apps to connect to your site). Note that the Social logins for commenting still work without 2-factor authentication.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d recommend taking similar steps for your sites. Waking up to an &#8220;uh-oh&#8221; feeling is no fun at all.</p>\n<p class=\"threads-post-notice\">This post is part of the thread: <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/passwords\">Passwords</a> &#8211; an ongoing story on this site.
